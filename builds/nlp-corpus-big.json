["\nDURING the dread reign of the Cholera in New York, I had accepted the\ninvitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement\nof his _cottage ornee_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around\nus all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling\nin the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books,\nwe should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful\nintelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city.\nNot a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some\nacquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily\nthe loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every\nmessenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.\nThat palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I\ncould neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was\nof a less excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in\nspirits, exerted himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical\nintellect was not at any time affected by unrealities. To the substances\nof terror he was sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no\napprehension.\n\nHis endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into\nwhich I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain\nvolumes which I had found in his library. These were of a character to\nforce into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition\nlay latent in my bosom. I had been reading these books without his\nknowledge, and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible\nimpressions which had been made upon my fancy.\n\nA favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens--a belief\nwhich, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed\nto defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions--he\nmaintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,--I\ncontending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity-\nthat is to say, without apparent traces of suggestion--had in itself the\nunmistakable elements of truth, and was entitled to as much respect\nas that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of\ngenius.\n\nThe fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had\noccurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had\nin it so much of the portentous character, that I might well have been\nexcused for regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time\nso confounded and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could\nmake up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend.\n\nNear the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at\nan open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a\nview of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been\ndenuded by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its\ntrees. My thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to\nthe gloom and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes\nfrom the page, they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an\nobject--upon some living monster of hideous conformation, which very\nrapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally\nin the dense forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I\ndoubted my own sanity--or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and\nmany minutes passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was\nneither mad nor in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which\nI distinctly saw, and calmly surveyed through the whole period of\nits progress), my readers, I fear, will feel more difficulty in being\nconvinced of these points than even I did myself.\n\nEstimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of\nthe large trees near which it passed--the few giants of the forest which\nhad escaped the fury of the land-slide--I concluded it to be far larger\nthan any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line, because\nthe shape of the monster suggested the idea--the hull of one of our\nseventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general\noutline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a\nproboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as\nthe body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was\nan immense quantity of black shaggy hair--more than could have been\nsupplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this\nhair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike\nthose of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending\nforward, parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a\ngigantic staff, thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure\ncrystal and in shape a perfect prism,--it reflected in the most gorgeous\nmanner the rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a\nwedge with the apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs\nof wings--each wing nearly one hundred yards in length--one pair being\nplaced above the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each\nscale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that\nthe upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But\nthe chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a\nDeath’s Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and\nwhich was as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of\nthe body, as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While\nI regarded the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance\non its breast, with a feeling or horror and awe--with a sentiment of\nforthcoming evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of\nthe reason, I perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis\nsuddenly expand themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so\nloud and so expressive of wo, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell\nand as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once,\nfainting, to the floor.\n\nUpon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend\nof what I had seen and heard--and I can scarcely explain what feeling of\nrepugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.\n\nAt length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we\nwere sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition--I\noccupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa\nnear at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to\ngive him an account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end--at first\nlaughed heartily--and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as\nif my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again\nhad a distinct view of the monster--to which, with a shout of absolute\nterror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly--but maintained\nthat he saw nothing--although I designated minutely the course of the\ncreature, as it made its way down the naked face of the hill.\n\nI was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an\nomen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I\nthrew myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried\nmy face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no\nlonger apparent.\n\nMy host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his\ndemeanor, and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the\nconformation of the visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied\nhim on this head, he sighed deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable\nburden, and went on to talk, with what I thought a cruel calmness, of\nvarious points of speculative philosophy, which had heretofore formed\nsubject of discussion between us. I remember his insisting very\nespecially (among other things) upon the idea that the principle\nsource of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of\nthe understanding to under-rate or to over-value the importance of an\nobject, through mere mis-admeasurement of its propinquity. “To estimate\nproperly, for example,” he said, “the influence to be exercised on\nmankind at large by the thorough diffusion of Democracy, the distance\nof the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should\nnot fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can you tell me one writer\non the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch\nof the subject worthy of discussion at all?”\n\nHe here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth\none of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to\nexchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine\nprint of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the\nbook, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.\n\n“But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the\nmonster, I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you\nwhat it was. In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy\naccount of the genus Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order\nLepidoptera, of the class of Insecta--or insects. The account runs thus:\n\n“‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic\nappearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation\nof the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of\nmandibles and downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior\nby a stiff hair; antennae in the form of an elongated club, prismatic;\nabdomen pointed, The Death’s--headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror\namong the vulgar, at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it\nutters, and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”\n\nHe here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing\nhimself accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of\nbeholding “the monster.”\n\n“Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed--“it is reascending the face\nof the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.\nStill, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,--for\nthe fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some\nspider has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the\nsixteenth of an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth\nof an inch distant from the pupil of my eye.”\n\n","My name is Jonas, I'm carrying the wheel.\nThanks for all you've shown us, but this is how we feel.\nCome sit next to me, pour yourself some tea.\nJust like grandma made, when we couldn't find sleep.\nThings were better then - once but never again.\nWe've all left the den. Let me tell you 'bout it.\n\nThe choo-choo train left right on time.\nA ticket costs only your mind.\nThe driver said, 'Hey man, we go all the way'.\nOf course we were willing to pay.\n\nMy name is Wepeel, I gotta box full of your toys.\nThey're fresh out of batteries, but they're still makin' noise (makin' noise).\nTell me what to do now the tank is dry.\nNow this wheel is flat, and you know what else?\nGuess what I received in the mail today?\nWords of deep concern from my little brother.\n\nThe building's not going as he planned.\nThe foreman has injured his hand.\nThe dozer will not clear a path.\nThe driver swears he learned his math .\n\n","Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, fellow citizens:\nAs a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of government share a great privilege: We've been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve. And tonight that is a privilege we share with newly-elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian Territories, Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq.\nTwo weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This evening I will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world.\nTonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with our nation an active force for good in the world — the state of our union is confident and strong.\nOur generation has been blessed — by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice. Now, as we see a little gray in the mirror — or a lot of gray — and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question: What will be the state of their union? Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer that question. Over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what Americans have always done, and build a better world for our children and our grandchildren.\nFirst, we must be good stewards of this economy, and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely. America's economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation. In the past four years, we provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest level in history, and in the last year alone, the United States has added 2.3 million new jobs. When action was needed, the Congress delivered — and the nation is grateful.\nNow we must add to these achievements. By making our economy more flexible, more innovative, and more competitive, we will keep America the economic leader of the world.\nAmerica's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government. I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline. I will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely, or not at all.\nTo make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century. Under the No Child Left Behind Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we're closing the achievement gap for minority students. Now we must demand better results from our high schools, so every high school diploma is a ticket to success. We will help an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career, by reforming our job training system and strengthening America's community colleges. And we'll make it easier for Americans to afford a college education, by increasing the size of Pell Grants.\nTo make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. Small business is the path of advancement, especially for women and minorities, so we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest job-creators from junk lawsuits. Justice is distorted, and our economy is held back by irresponsible class-actions and frivolous asbestos claims — and I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year.\nTo make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care more affordable, and give families greater access to good coverage — and more control over their health decisions. I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in every poor county, improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs, association health plans for small businesses and their employees — — expanded health savings accounts — and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need.\nTo keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable, environmentally responsible energy. Nearly four years ago, I submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid, and more production here at home — including safe, clean nuclear energy. My Clear Skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens. And my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge technology — from hydrogen-fueled cars, to clean coal, to renewable sources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough: I urge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent on foreign energy.\nAll these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs — but they are just the beginning of our duty. To build the prosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time. Year after year, Americans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent federal tax code. I've appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom. And when their recommendations are delivered, you and I will work together to give this nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy to understand, and fair to all.\nAmerica's immigration system is also outdated — unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country. We should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, and invite chaos at our border. It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.\nOne of America's most important institutions — a symbol of the trust between generations — is also in need of wise and effective reform. Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century. The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security.\nToday, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and millions more are nearing retirement — and for them the system is sound and fiscally strong. I have a message for every American who is 55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you; for you, the Social Security system will not change in any way. For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time. Social Security was created decades ago, for a very different era. In those days, people did not live as long. Benefits were much lower than they are today. And a half-century ago, about sixteen workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits.\nOur society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not have foreseen. In today's world, people are living longer and, therefore, drawing benefits longer. And those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades. And instead of sixteen workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only about three workers. And over the next few decades that number will fall to just two workers per beneficiary. With each passing year, fewer workers are paying ever-higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees.\nSo here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security will be paying out more than it takes in. And every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before. For example, in the year 2027, the government will somehow have to come up with an extra $200 billion to keep the system afloat — and by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more than $300 billion. By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt. If steps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in Social Security benefits or other government programs.\nI recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates are not so distant, as any parent will tell you. If you have a five-year-old, you're already concerned about how you'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road. If you've got children in their 20s, as some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter. And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress. You and I share a responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of Social Security once and for all.\nFixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review of the options. Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees. Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages. During the 1990s, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age. Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated. All these ideas are on the table.\nI know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, because our children's retirement security is more important than partisan politics. I will work with members of Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms. I will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer. We must, however, be guided by some basic principles. We must make Social Security permanently sound, not leave that task for another day. We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes. We must ensure that lower-income Americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement. We must guarantee there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement. And we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future.\nAs we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts. Here is how the idea works. Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today's retirees. If you're a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future.\nHere's why the personal accounts are a better deal. Your money will grow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver — and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security. In addition, you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children and — or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account is yours, and the government can never take it away.\nThe goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts. We'll make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We'll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We'll make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement. We'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once, but rather paid out over time, as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits. And we'll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible, by starting personal retirement accounts gradually, and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside four percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts.\nPersonal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees, because you already have something similar, called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly-based investment funds. It's time to extend the same security, and choice, and ownership to young Americans.\nOur second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. So many of my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith, and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children. Government is not the source of these values, but government should never undermine them.\nBecause marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it should not be re-defined by activist judges. For the good of families, children, and society, I support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage.\nBecause a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we must strive to build a culture of life. Medical research can help us reach that goal, by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities — and I thank the Congress for doubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health. To build a culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others. We should all be able to agree — — we should all be able to agree on some clear standards. I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts, and that human life is never bought and sold as a commodity. America will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and always ethical.\nBecause courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. As President, I have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy, and are well-qualified to serve on the bench — and I have done so. The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves an up or down vote.\nBecause one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America. Our government will continue to support faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. Now we need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our cities, better options than apathy, or gangs, or jail. Tonight I propose a three-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs, and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence. Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches and community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to sports. And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our First Lady, Laura Bush.\nBecause HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention, and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease. And as we update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases, African American men and women.\nBecause one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice. In America we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit — so we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction. Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side.\nOur third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America that is safe from danger, and protected by peace. We will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy — and chief among them is freedom from fear.\nIn the three and a half years since September the 11th, 2001, we have taken unprecedented actions to protect Americans. We've created a new department of government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on preventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and trained more than a half-million first responders. Police and firefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all.\nOur nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad, with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing. The al Qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders — but many of its top commanders have been removed. There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists — but their number has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction — but no longer without attention and without consequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many, and intimidate us all — and we will stay on the offensive against them, until the fight is won.\nPursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror — and I thank the Congress for providing our servicemen and women with the resources they have needed. During this time of war, we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory.\nOther nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, an international force is helping provide security. In Iraq, 28 countries have troops on the ground, the United Nations and the European Union provided technical assistance for the elections, and NATO is leading a mission to help train Iraqi officers. We're cooperating with 60 governments in the Proliferation Security Initiative, to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials. We're working closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine other countries have captured or detained al Qaeda terrorists. In the next four years, my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time.\nIn the long-term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder. If whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk America and other free nations for decades. The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror, and replace hatred with hope, is the force of human freedom. Our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the \"evil principle\" of democracy. And we've declared our own intention: America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.\nThe United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else. That is one of the main differences between us and our enemies. They seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life. Our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with governments that answer to their citizens, and reflect their own cultures. And because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace.\nThat advance has great momentum in our time — shown by women voting in Afghanistan, and Palestinians choosing a new direction, and the people of Ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president. We are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty. And in the coming years, we will add to that story.\nThe beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure. Tomorrow morning, Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will take her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas. She will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful, independent, democratic state. To promote this democracy, I will ask Congress for $350 million to support Palestinian political, economic, and security reforms. The goal of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace, is within reach — and America will help them achieve that goal.\nTo promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United States will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom. Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain. The government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future. And the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle East.\nTo promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder. Syria still allows its territory, and parts of Lebanon, to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region. You have passed, and we are applying, the Syrian Accountability Act — and we expect the Syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom. Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror — pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve. We are working with European allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing, and end its support for terror. And to the Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you.\nOur generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the Middle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq. That country is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in Iraq, so we do not have to face them here at home. And the victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren.\nWe will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty — as they showed the world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new Transitional National Assembly. A young woman in Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day, and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote. She said, \"Hearing those explosions, it occurred to me — the insurgents are weak, they are afraid of democracy, they are losing. So I got my husband, and I got my parents, and we all came out and voted together.\"\nAmericans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it. In any nation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility; for millions of Iraqis, it was also an act of personal courage, and they have earned the respect of us all.\nOne of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb al-Suhail. She says of her country, \"We were occupied for 35 years by Saddam Hussein. That was the real occupation. Thank you to the American people who paid the cost, but most of all, to the soldiers.\" Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country — and we are honored that she is with us tonight.\nThe terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy, and will continue to attack it. Yet, the terrorists' most powerful myth is being destroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are trying to destroy the hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections. And the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people.\nWe will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom, and to write their own history. As Prime Minister Allawi said in his speech to Congress last September, \"Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible.\" That is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it is also the stated mission of our coalition in Iraq. The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country.\nAt the recommendation of our commanders on the ground, and in consultation with the Iraqi government, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security forces — forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure. As those forces become more self-reliant and take on greater security responsibilities, America and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis must be able to defend their own country — and we will help that proud, new nation secure its liberty.\nRecently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, \"Tell America not to abandon us.\" He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging. We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqi friends, and freedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come. We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out. We are in Iraq to achieve a result: A country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, and able to defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned.\nRight now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often taking great risks on my orders. We have given them training and equipment; and they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every American proud. The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and decency, and every day they're making our nation more secure. Some of our servicemen and women have survived terrible injuries, and this grateful country will do everything we can to help them recover. And we have said farewell to some very good men and women, who died for our freedom, and whose memory this nation will honor forever.\nOne name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah. His mom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a Marine, and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror. She wrote, \"When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born. He just hugged me and said, 'You've done your job, Mom. Now it is my turn to protect you.'\" Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom's defenders, and our military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood's mom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood.\nIn these four years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events. We have known times of sorrow, and hours of uncertainty, and days of victory. In all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us. The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world. We are all part of a great venture: To extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty, and to spread the peace that freedom brings.\nAs Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, \"Each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth.\" And we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born. The abolition of slavery was only a dream — until it was fulfilled. The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream — until it was achieved. The fall of imperial communism was only a dream — until, one day, it was accomplished. Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence. The road of Providence is uneven and unpredictable — yet we know where it leads: It leads to freedom.\nThank you, and may God bless America.\n","\nIn the internal decoration, if not in the external architecture of\ntheir residences, the English are supreme. The Italians have but little\nsentiment beyond marbles and colours. In France, _meliora probant,\ndeteriora _sequuntur--the people are too much a race of gadabouts to\nmaintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a\ndelicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The\nChinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate\nfancy. The Scotch are _poor _decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an\nindeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain they are\n_all _curtains--a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The\nHottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone\nare preposterous.\n\nHow this happens, it is not difficult to see. We have no aristocracy of\nblood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable\nthing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the _display\nof wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the\nheraldic display in monarchical countries. By a transition readily\nunderstood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been\nbrought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself.\n\nTo speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere parade\nof costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create\nan impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances\nthemselves--or of taste as regards the proprietor:--this for the reason,\nfirst, that wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition\nas constituting a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility\nof blood, confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste,\nrather avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu\n_rivalry may at any time be successfully attempted.\n\nThe people _will _imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough\ndiffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being\nthe sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general,\nto be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace,\nlooking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two\nentirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost\nof an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly\nthe sole test of its merit in a decorative point of view--and this test,\nonce established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily\ntraceable to the one primitive folly.\n\nThere could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist\nthan the interior of what is termed in the United States--that is to\nsay, in Appallachia--a well-furnished apartment. Its most usual defect\nis a want of keeping. We speak of the keeping of a room as we would of\nthe keeping of a picture--for both the picture and the room are amenable\nto those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of art; and\nvery nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits of a\npainting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber.\n\nA want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the\nseveral pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of\nadaptation to use _Very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic\narrangement. Straight lines are too prevalent--too uninterruptedly\ncontinued--or clumsily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines\noccur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision,\nthe appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.\n\nCurtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other\ndecorations. With formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an\nextensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance,\nirreconcilable with good taste--the proper quantum, as well as the\nproper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect.\n\nCarpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we\nstill very frequently err in their patterns and colours. The soul of the\napartment is the carpet. From it are deduced not only the hues but the\nforms of all objects incumbent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary\nman; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius. Yet we have heard\ndiscoursing of carpets, with the air “_d’un mouton qui reve,” _fellows\nwho should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of\ntheir own _moustaches. _Every one knows that a large floor _may _have a\ncovering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering\nof small--yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. As\nregards texture, the Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the\npreterpluperfect tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying\nagonies. Touching pattern--a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like\na Riccaree Indian--all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. In\nbrief--distinct grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, _of\nno meaning, _are here Median laws. The abomination of flowers, or\nrepresentations of well-known objects of any kind, should not be\nendured within the limits of Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets,\nor curtains, or tapestry, or ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this\nnature should be rigidly Arabesque. As for those antique floor-cloth &\nstill occasionally seen in the dwellings of the rabble--cloths of huge,\nsprawling, and radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious\nwith all hues, among which no ground is intelligible--these are but the\nwicked invention of a race of time-servers and money-lovers--children\nof Baal and worshippers of Mammon--Benthams, who, to spare thought\nand economize fancy, first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope, and then\nestablished joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam.\n\n _Glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of American household\ndecoration--an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion of\ntaste just specified., We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass.\nThe former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady\nlight offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild,\nor what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows,\nwill do wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more\nlovely thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course,\nthe astral lamp proper--the lamp of Argand, with its original plain\nground-glass shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The\ncut-glass shade is a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with\nwhich we have adopted it, partly on account of its _flashiness,_ but\nprincipally on account of its _greater rest,_ is a good commentary on\nthe proposition with which we began. It is not too much to say, that the\ndeliberate employer of a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient\nin taste, or blindly subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light\nproceeding from one of these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and\npainful. It alone is sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the\nfurniture subjected to its influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is\nmore than one-half disenchanted beneath its evil eye.\n\nIn the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. Its\nleading feature is _glitter--_and in that one word how much of all that\nis detestable do we express! Flickering, unquiet lights, are _sometimes\n_pleasing--to children and idiots always so--but in the embellishment\nof a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth, even strong\n_steady _lights are inadmissible. The huge and unmeaning glass\nchandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle in\nour most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of\nall that is false in taste or preposterous in folly.\n\nThe rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before\nobserved, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract--has\nled us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. We line our\ndwellings with great British plates, and then imagine we have done a\nfine thing. Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince\nany one who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous\nlooking-glasses, and especially of large ones. Regarded apart from\nits reflection, the mirror presents a continuous, flat, colourless,\nunrelieved surface,--a thing always and obviously unpleasant. Considered\nas a reflector, it is potent in producing a monstrous and odious\nuniformity: and the evil is here aggravated, not in merely direct\nproportion with the augmentation of its sources, but in a ratio\nconstantly increasing. In fact, a room with four or five mirrors\narranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show, a room of\nno shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter upon\nglitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing\neffects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,\nwould be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be\naltogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let\nthe same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be\nstartled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.\n\nIt is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a\nman of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in\nit. The corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the\ndollar-manufacture. As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is,\ntherefore, not among _our _aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in\nAppallachia), for the spirituality of a British _boudoir. _But we have\nseen apartments in the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly “modest”\n or “moderate”] means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with\nany of the _or-molu’d _cabinets of our friends across the water. Even\n_now_, there is present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious\nchamber with whose decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor\nlies asleep on a sofa--the weather is cool--the time is near midnight:\nwe will make a sketch of the room during his slumber.\n\nIt is oblong--some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth--a\nshape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of\nfurniture. It has but one door--by no means a wide one--which is at one\nend of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the\nother. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor--have deep\nrecesses--and open on an Italian _veranda. _Their panes are of a\ncrimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than\nusual. They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue\nadapted to the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small\nvolumes. Without the recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson\nsilk, fringed with a deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue,\nwhich is the material of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but\nthe folds of the whole fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and\nhave an airy appearance), issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich\ngiltwork, which encircles the room at the junction of the ceiling and\nwalls. The drapery is thrown open also, or closed, by means of a thick\nrope of gold loosely enveloping it, and resolving itself readily into\na knot; no pins or other such devices are apparent. The colours of\nthe curtains and their fringe--the tints of crimson and gold--appear\neverywhere in profusion, and determine the _character _of the room. The\ncarpet--of Saxony material--is quite half an inch thick, and is of the\nsame crimson ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord\n(like that festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface\nof the _ground, _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a\nsuccession of short irregular curves--one occasionally overlaying the\nother. The walls are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint,\nspotted with small Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent\ncrimson. Many paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly\nlandscapes of an imaginative cast--such as the fairy grottoes of\nStanfield, or the lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There\nare, nevertheless, three or four female heads, of an ethereal\nbeauty-portraits in the manner of Sully. The tone of each picture is\nwarm, but dark. There are no “brilliant effects.” _Repose _speaks in\nall. Not one is of small size. Diminutive paintings give that _spotty\n_look to a room, which is the blemish of so many a fine work of Art\novertouched. The frames are broad but not deep, and richly carved,\nwithout being _dulled _or filagreed. They have the whole lustre of\nburnished gold. They lie flat on the walls, and do not hang off with\ncords. The designs themselves are often seen to better advantage in this\nlatter position, but the general appearance of the chamber is injured.\nBut one mirror--and this not a very large one--is visible. In shape it\nis nearly circular--and it is hung so that a reflection of the person\ncan be obtained from it in none of the ordinary sitting-places of the\nroom. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson silk, gold-flowered,\nform the only seats, with the exception of two light conversation\nchairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood, also),\nwithout cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed altogether of\nthe richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the sofas. This\nis also without cover--the drapery of the curtains has been thought\nsufficient.. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which bloom a\nprofusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded angles\nof the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with\nhighly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend.\nSome light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson\nsilk cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently\nbound books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except\nan Argand lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which\ndepends from He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain,\nand throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all.\n\n","HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy\nPrince.  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes\nhe had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his\nsword-hilt.\n\nHe was very much admired indeed.  “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,”\nremarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for\nhaving artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing\nlest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\n\n“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible mother of her\nlittle boy who was crying for the moon.  “The Happy Prince never dreams\nof crying for anything.”\n\n“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a\ndisappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\n\n“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out\nof the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white\npinafores.\n\n“How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen\none.”\n\n“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the\nMathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not\napprove of children dreaming.\n\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had\ngone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was\nin love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring\nas he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so\nattracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\n\n“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at\nonce, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her,\ntouching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was\nhis courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\n“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has\nno money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite\nfull of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.\n\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.\n“She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a\ncoquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.”  And certainly,\nwhenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  “I\nadmit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my\nwife, consequently, should love travelling also.”\n\n“Will you come away with me?” he said finally to her; but the Reed shook\nher head, she was so attached to her home.\n\n“You have been trifling with me,” he cried.  “I am off to the Pyramids.\nGood-bye!” and he flew away.\n\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  “Where\nshall I put up?” he said; “I hope the town has made preparations.”\n\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\n\n“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of\nfresh air.”  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\n\n“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round,\nand he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under\nhis wing a large drop of water fell on him.  “What a curious thing!” he\ncried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear\nand bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is\nreally dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her\nselfishness.”\n\nThen another drop fell.\n\n“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he said; “I\nmust look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.\n\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up,\nand saw—Ah! what did he see?\n\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were\nrunning down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the\nmoonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\n\n“Who are you?” he said.\n\n“I am the Happy Prince.”\n\n“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched\nme.”\n\n“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not\nknow what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where\nsorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my\ncompanions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great\nHall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask\nwhat lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers\ncalled me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be\nhappiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have\nset me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery\nof my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but\nweep.”\n\n“What! is he not solid gold?” said the Swallow to himself.  He was too\npolite to make any personal remarks out loud.\n\n“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a\nlittle street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and\nthrough it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and\nworn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she\nis a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for\nthe loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next\nCourt-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying\nill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing\nto give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little\nSwallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet\nare fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow.  “My friends are flying up\nand down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they\nwill go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there\nhimself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and\nembalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and\nhis hands are like withered leaves.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and\nthe mother so sad.”\n\n“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow.  “Last summer, when I\nwas staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons,\nwho were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we\nswallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family\nfamous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.”\n\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.\n“It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one night,\nand be your messenger.”\n\n“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.\n\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and\nflew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\n\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were\nsculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A\nbeautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  “How wonderful\nthe stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the power of love!”\n\n“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she answered;\n“I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the\nseamstresses are so lazy.”\n\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of\nthe ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining\nwith each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he\ncame to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on\nhis bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he\nhopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble.\nThen he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his\nwings.  “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and\nhe sank into a delicious slumber.\n\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had\ndone.  “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although\nit is so cold.”\n\n“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince.  And the\nlittle Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always\nmade him sleepy.\n\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  “What a\nremarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was\npassing over the bridge.  “A swallow in winter!”  And he wrote a long\nletter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full\nof so many words that they could not understand.\n\n“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at\nthe prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time\non top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped,\nand said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so he enjoyed\nhimself very much.\n\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  “Have you any\ncommissions for Egypt?” he cried; “I am just starting.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow.  “To-morrow my friends\nwill fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among\nthe bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All\nnight long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he\nutters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions\ncome down to the water’s edge to drink.  They have eyes like green\nberyls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the\ncity I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered\nwith papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered\nviolets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a\npomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a\nplay for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any\nmore.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.”\n\n“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really had\na good heart.  “Shall I take him another ruby?”\n\n“Alas!  I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I\nhave left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of\nIndia a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.\nHe will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish\nhis play.”\n\n“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to\nweep.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the\nstudent’s garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in\nthe roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man\nhad his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the\nbird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying\non the withered violets.\n\n“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some great\nadmirer.  Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.\n\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of\na large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold\nwith ropes.  “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up.  “I am\ngoing to Egypt”! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon\nrose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n\n“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be\nhere.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the\ncrocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are\nbuilding a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves\nare watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave\nyou, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back\ntwo beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby\nshall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the\ngreat sea.”\n\n“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little\nmatch-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all\nspoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money,\nand she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is\nbare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will\nnot beat her.”\n\n“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot\npluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it.  He\nswooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her\nhand.  “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran\nhome, laughing.\n\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince.  “You are blind now,” he said,\n“so I will stay with you always.”\n\n“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt.”\n\n“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the\nPrince’s feet.\n\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of\nwhat he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who\nstand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their\nbeaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the\ndesert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the\nside of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King\nof the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a\nlarge crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and\nhas twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who\nsail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the\nbutterflies.\n\n“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous\nthings, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of\nwomen.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little\nSwallow, and tell me what you see there.”\n\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in\ntheir beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He\nflew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children\nlooking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a\nbridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep\nthemselves warm.  “How hungry we are!” they said.  “You must not lie\nhere,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\n\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\n\n“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off,\nleaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold\ncan make them happy.”\n\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy\nPrince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he\nbrought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier, and they\nlaughed and played games in the street.  “We have bread now!” they cried.\n\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets\nlooked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and\nglistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of\nthe houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore\nscarlet caps and skated on the ice.\n\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave\nthe Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the\nbaker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself\nwarm by flapping his wings.\n\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to\nfly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more.  “Good-bye, dear Prince!” he\nmurmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?”\n\n“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the\nPrince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips,\nfor I love you.”\n\n“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow.  “I am going to\nthe House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?”\n\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his\nfeet.\n\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something\nhad broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.\nIt certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\n\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in\ncompany with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked\nup at the statue: “Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!” he said.\n\n“How shabby indeed!” cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with\nthe Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\n\n“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is\ngolden no longer,” said the Mayor in fact, “he is litttle better than a\nbeggar!”\n\n“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors.\n\n“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!” continued the Mayor.  “We\nmust really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die\nhere.”  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\n\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  “As he is no longer\nbeautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the\nUniversity.\n\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of\nthe Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  “We must\nhave another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a statue of\nmyself.”\n\n“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.\nWhen I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.\n\n“What a strange thing!” said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.\n“This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it\naway.”  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also\nlying.\n\n“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to one of\nHis Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\n\n“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of Paradise this\nlittle bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy\nPrince shall praise me.”\n\n","He's a real nowhere man\nSitting in his nowhere land\nMaking all his nowhere plans for nobody\n\nDoesn't have a point of view\nKnows not where he's going to\nIsn't he a bit like you and me?\nNowhere man please listen\nYou don't know what you're missing\nNowhere man, The world is at your command\n\nHe's as blind as he can be\nJust sees what he wants to see\nNowhere man, can you see me at all\nNowhere man don't worry\nTake your time, don't hurry\nLeave it all till somebody else\nLends you a hand\n\nDoesn't have a point of view\nKnows not where he's going to\nIsn't he a bit like you and me?\nNowhere man please listen\nYou don't know what you're missing\nNowhere man, The world is at your command\n\n","Ya I will do it. Tsk auntie, you very naggy leh.","Hi!\nHey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the  way over here for?\nOkay, our news. My company has asked me to head  up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.\nOh my God!\nWhat?!\nWhat?!\nMonday?!\nHow long do you have to go for?\nThey said it could be up to a year.\nA year?!\nDo you have to go?\nI kind of have to don't I?

Trust me, I know this.\nAll right, I trust you.\nRachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...\nI'm on the phone!\nIt's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby.  It's just so grown up.\nI know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person  named Wiener, God that kills me.\nLook at you all grown up.\nActually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with  Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship.  You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks  aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.\nYou know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you  set me up with someone, and we double date!\nI can do that, yeah. How is Friday?\nDone. Oh good, really?\nYeah!\nLet's see! Oh, you know  who's great? Sandy Poophack.\nYeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller\nHey!\nHey!\nI've got good news!\nYou got out of the whole Tulsa thing?\nOkay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa.  You can stay here and keep your job.\nIt's great! How?\nChandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only  have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with  you.\nSo you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.\nI'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?\nNo. I can't be away from you for that long.\nReally?\nYeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a  different state than you for 208 days out of the year.\nThat's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.\nHoney, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but  if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.\nHey, you said that without gagging!\nI know!Who the hell was that?!\nDr. Wiener.\nRach, you can't call people at three in the morning.\nOh you know what, you sound just like his wife!\nWas there anything you did wrong with Emma?\nYes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!\nWell, what was it?\nHiccups.\nRach, I told you, you can't call him every time any  little thing comes up.\nYeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What  are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that  when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?\nDr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a  good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.\nArgh! Why does everything happen to me?!\nRach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another  doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.\nWhat? What, do you mean you're not feeling well?  What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had  that shot.\nYou know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!\nWiener, Wiener!!!\nRachel!!!\nGreat! Now he's gonna know it was me!\nHey!\nHey!\nSo how is this for our big double date tonight?\nOh my God!\nOoh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.\nYeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?\nOf course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen.  She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this,  but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.\nNo.\nCome on, give me something. What's his name?\nMike.\nMike? Okay! What's his last name?\nDamnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?\nAll right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant  in a couple hours.\nWhy did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why  couldn't I have said... There's no guy in  there!\nIt's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how  do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against  your knee?\nExcuse me?\nI know what she's talking about.\nWe've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting  sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.\nWhy don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?\nRoss said he died.\nHe didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said  he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.\nOh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see  him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.\nOh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood  therapist.\nHe saw a therapist?\nYeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just  really freaked him out.\nWhy? What was it?\nThat I was going to eat him.\nMIKE!!!\nYeah?\nI gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with  you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I  should be open and taking some risks.\nEverything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay?  All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.\nI am Mike.\nAtta boy!\nOkay, look...\nEveryone:\nJoey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do  you and Joey know each other anyway?\nHow do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a  nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.\nFrom school.\nYeah, we met in college. I mean,  high school.\nWow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up  to these days?\nWell, I'm a lawyer.\nMike, 'attorney at law'!\nActually, I just gave up my practice.\nWhat? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.\nI always wanted to play piano professionally, and I  figured if I don't do this now, I never will.\nWow, that's great! I liked that better than the law  thing, so...\nWhich is why I waited until now to introduce you to  Mike.\nMary Ellen: I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.\nNo, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.\nHey!\nHey!\nWhat are you doing?\nLooking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.\nThat's so sweet. Find anything?\nSlim Pickings.\nNothing, huh?\nNo, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant.  They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're  looking for someone to shovel mesquite.\n'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.\n'So Cheesy' also has an opening.\nHoney, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy,  who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.\nCan I just say how much I appreciate you coming  with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.  'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.\n'I'll take it!'\nHi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment  for Emma.\nDr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient,  he should be out shortly.\nI think you just have a cold,  it's definitely not Strep.\nThanks doctor.\nWould you like a lollypop?\nYou even have to ask?! He is alive!\nYou know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have  known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.\nYeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out.  Mike hit my mom with a car.\nNo, I didn't.\nThat's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're  friends again everything's great!\nMary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?\nPlease, we're trying to have a conversation.\nMary Ellen: Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.\n'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!\nWhat?!\nWhat?!\nWhat?!\nDo you not know each other?\nHey, remember the one where I punch  you in the face for not being cool?!\nMike, let me ask you something. How many sisters  does Joey have?\nSix!\nWhat are you doing? I said seven! Argh!!!\nJoey, why did you set me up with a stranger?\nBecause I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.\nI'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his  mother with a car.\nYou are unbelievable! I spent so much time  finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and  cute and loose.\nMary Ellen: Hey!\nWho are you kidding? You just find some  guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!\nLook Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like  this guy I can find you a better one. Mike!! Mike!!\nI'm out of here\nIt was nice meeting you!\nYou're leaving too?\nMary Ellen: I'll stay if you can tell me my name.\nGood night!\nHoney, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got  a lot of packing to do.\nYou're right. Maybe I shouldn't go.\nWhat?\nSo Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,  Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.\nHow far outside?\nManhattan.\nAnd you're thinking of taking it? new job.\nI'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot  to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\nWhat happened to 'you can't live without me four  days a week'?\nWell, if you really think about it, I mean four days  is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see  you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really  if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make  it one day, we've got real problems my friend.\nI think you should take the job.\nReally?\nYeah. I know it must be important to you when you  start chattering like a monkey.\nThat's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!\nHey!\nHow was the pediatrician?\nOh, I really liked him. Yeah, it  was really, really, really good.\nYou promised you wouldn't say anything.\nI know. I don't care!\nAre you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?\nHe's a brilliant diagnostician!\nDiagnostician or boo-boo fixer?\nRoss, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate  doctor.\nWhy? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's  a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,  he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'\nDoes he say that before he sticks his thermometer  in your touchy?\nHey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security  blanket to college!\nThat was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!\nIt didn't spend much time on the wall!!!\nExcuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can  we talk?\nSure.\nI'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm  a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny  guy.\nWhy did you go along with that?\nBecause I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't.  And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.\nThat's true. Well, is anything you told me  about yourself true?\nMy name in Mike, and I do play piano.\nProve it.\nThere isn't a piano here.\nThat wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.\nMike:\nYou are really good! I play a little guitar myself.\nReally?\nUhuh.\nThat's great. What kind of music do you play?\nWell, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right  now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.\nDo you think that maybe, sometime, I could...\nIt's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.\nOkay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you  out?\nOh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah,  that would be nice.\nLook at this. My two best friends!\nExcuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby  with the rash came in after me.\nThe doctor will be right with you sir.\nMommy, I can't find Waldo.\nWith the circus? He's behind the elephant.\nWow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books  too?\nYeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.\nHi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also  a single parent?\nI am a single parent.\nIt's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social  life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?\nWell, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the  pediatrician's office.\nRossy, we're ready for you.\nHmm, yeah. Come  on Ross jr. It's time to go in.\nMommy\nMommy, what's wrong with that man?\nHey, I helped you find Waldo!\nOh good, you haven't left yet.\nWhere have you been?\nI got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was  some guy that freaked everybody out.\nWell, you got here just in time. I really have  to go buddy.\nOh man.\nPromise to call me when you land.\nOf course I will call you. I love you.\nI love you too.\nOkay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've  got a baby over here.\nBye Chandler.\nAwww. Bye!\nBye honey.\nWhat's the  matter Joe?\nI'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big  leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.\nAny chance you are trying to pick a fight to make  all this easier?\nDude, you see right thru me!!\nWell, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!\nOkay, bye-bye!\nyou. This  is just something I have to do.\nI know.\nI love you so much.\nI know that too.\nDon't worry, I'll be back before  you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.\nDouble promise? Call me  when you land.\nCan I talk now?\nOkay, bye.\nJoey?\nHe had to board.\n","IT was well said of a certain German book that “_er lasst sich nicht\nlesen_”--it does not permit itself to be read. There are some secrets\nwhich do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in their\nbeds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them\npiteously in the eyes--die with despair of heart and convulsion of\nthroat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer\nthemselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the conscience of man\ntakes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only\ninto the grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.\n\nNot long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the\nlarge bow window of the D----- Coffee-House in London. For some months\nI had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with returning\nstrength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so\nprecisely the converse of ennui--moods of the keenest appetency, when\nthe film from the mental vision departs--the [Greek phrase]--and the\nintellect, electrified, surpasses as greatly its every-day condition,\nas does the vivid yet candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy\nrhetoric of Gorgias. Merely to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived\npositive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain. I\nfelt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing. With a cigar in\nmy mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had been amusing myself for the\ngreater part of the afternoon, now in poring over advertisements, now\nin observing the promiscuous company in the room, and now in peering\nthrough the smoky panes into the street.\n\nThis latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had\nbeen very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came\non, the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well\nlighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past\nthe door. At this particular period of the evening I had never before\nbeen in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads\nfilled me, therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up,\nat length, all care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in\ncontemplation of the scene without.\n\nAt first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn.\nI looked at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their\naggregate relations. Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded\nwith minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air,\ngait, visage, and expression of countenance.\n\nBy far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied\nbusiness-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their\nway through the press. Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled\nquickly; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom\nof impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still\na numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces,\nand talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude\non account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in\ntheir progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled\ntheir gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile\nupon the lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled,\nthey bowed profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with\nconfusion.--There was nothing very distinctive about these two large\nclasses beyond what I have noted. Their habiliments belonged to that\norder which is pointedly termed the decent. They were undoubtedly\nnoblemen, merchants, attorneys, tradesmen, stock-jobbers--the Eupatrids\nand the common-places of society--men of leisure and men actively\nengaged in affairs of their own--conducting business upon their own\nresponsibility. They did not greatly excite my attention.\n\nThe tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned\ntwo remarkable divisions. There were the junior clerks of flash\nhouses--young gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair,\nand supercilious lips. Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage,\nwhich may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of\nthese persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the\nperfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. They wore\nthe cast-off graces of the gentry;--and this, I believe, involves the\nbest definition of the class.\n\nThe division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the “steady\nold fellows,” it was not possible to mistake. These were known by their\ncoats and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with\nwhite cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose\nor gaiters.--They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right\nears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on\nend. I observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both\nhands, and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and\nancient pattern. Theirs was the affectation of respectability;--if\nindeed there be an affectation so honorable.\n\nThere were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily\nunderstood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which\nall great cities are infested. I watched these gentry with much\ninquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever\nbe mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. Their voluminousness\nof wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at\nonce.\n\nThe gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily\nrecognisable. They wore every variety of dress, from that of the\ndesperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief,\ngilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate\nclergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still\nall were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a\nfilmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two\nother traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them;--a guarded\nlowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of\nthe thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers.--Very often,\nin company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat\ndifferent in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. They may be\ndefined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey\nupon the public in two battalions--that of the dandies and that of the\nmilitary men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and\nsmiles; of the second frogged coats and frowns.\n\nDescending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker\nand deeper themes for speculation. I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes\nflashing from countenances whose every other feature wore only an\nexpression of abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars\nscowling upon mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had\ndriven forth into the night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids,\nupon whom death had placed a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered\nthrough the mob, looking every one beseechingly in the face, as if in\nsearch of some chance consolation, some lost hope; modest young girls\nreturning from long and late labor to a cheerless home, and shrinking\nmore tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians, whose\ndirect contact, even, could not be avoided; women of the town of all\nkinds and of all ages--the unequivocal beauty in the prime of her\nwomanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in Lucian, with the surface\nof Parian marble, and the interior filled with filth--the loathsome and\nutterly lost leper in rags--the wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed\nbeldame, making a last effort at youth--the mere child of immature form,\nyet, from long association, an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her\ntrade, and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her\nelders in vice; drunkards innumerable and indescribable--some in shreds\nand patches, reeling, inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre\neyes--some in whole although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady\nswagger, thick sensual lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces--others\nclothed in materials which had once been good, and which even now were\nscrupulously well brushed--men who walked with a more than naturally\nfirm and springy step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose\neyes hideously wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as\nthey strode through the crowd, at every object which came within\ntheir reach; beside these, pie-men, porters, coal--heavers, sweeps;\norgan-grinders, monkey-exhibiters and ballad mongers, those who vended\nwith those who sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every\ndescription, and all full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which\njarred discordantly upon the ear, and gave an aching sensation to the\neye.\n\nAs the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for\nnot only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its\ngentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly\nportion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder\nrelief, as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its\nden,) but the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle\nwith the dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over\nevery thing a fitful and garish lustre. All was dark yet splendid--as\nthat ebony to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.\n\nThe wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of\nindividual faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of\nlight flitted before the window, prevented me from casting more than\na glance upon each visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar\nmental state, I could frequently read, even in that brief interval of a\nglance, the history of long years.\n\nWith my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob,\nwhen suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old\nman, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)--a countenance which\nat once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the\nabsolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. Any thing even remotely\nresembling that expression I had never seen before. I well remember that\nmy first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it,\nwould have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the\nfiend. As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey,\nto form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly\nand paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of\ncaution, of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of\nblood thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror,\nof intense--of supreme despair. I felt singularly aroused, startled,\nfascinated. “How wild a history,” I said to myself, “is written within\nthat bosom!” Then came a craving desire to keep the man in view--to know\nmore of him. Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and\ncane, I made my way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in\nthe direction which I had seen him take; for he had already disappeared.\nWith some little difficulty I at length came within sight of him,\napproached, and followed him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to\nattract his attention.\n\nI had now a good opportunity of examining his person. He was short in\nstature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally,\nwere filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong\nglare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of\nbeautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a\nclosely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped\nhim, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. These\nobservations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the\nstranger whithersoever he should go.\n\nIt was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city,\nsoon ending in a settled and heavy rain. This change of weather had an\nodd effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new\ncommotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the\njostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. For my own part I\ndid not much regard the rain--the lurking of an old fever in my system\nrendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a\nhandkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man\nheld his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here\nwalked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never\nonce turning his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and bye he\npassed into a cross street, which, although densely filled with people,\nwas not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a\nchange in his demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with\nless object than before--more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed\nthe way repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so\nthick that, at every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely.\nThe street was a narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for\nnearly an hour, during which the passengers had gradually diminished to\nabout that number which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the\nPark--so vast a difference is there between a London populace and that\nof the most frequented American city. A second turn brought us into a\nsquare, brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. The old manner\nof the stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his\neyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon\nthose who hemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I\nwas surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of\nthe square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I\nastonished to see him repeat the same walk several times--once nearly\ndetecting me as he came round with a sudden movement.\n\nIn this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with\nfar less interruption from passengers than at first. The rain fell fast;\nthe air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. With\na gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a bye-street\ncomparatively deserted. Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he\nrushed with an activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so\naged, and which put me to much trouble in pursuit. A few minutes brought\nus to a large and busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger\nappeared well acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became\napparent, as he forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host\nof buyers and sellers.\n\nDuring the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this\nplace, it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach\nwithout attracting his observation. Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc\nover-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence. At no moment did\nhe see that I watched him. He entered shop after shop, priced nothing,\nspoke no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare.\nI was now utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we\nshould not part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting\nhim.\n\nA loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting\nthe bazaar. A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old\nman, and at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. He\nhurried into the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and\nthen ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less\nlanes, until we emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we\nhad started--the street of the D---- Hotel. It no longer wore, however,\nthe same aspect. It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell\nfiercely, and there were few persons to be seen. The stranger grew pale.\nHe walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a\nheavy sigh, turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through\na great variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of\nthe principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were\nthronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while\nhe threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of\nhis countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon\nhis breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that\nhe now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the\naudience--but, upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the\nwaywardness of his actions.\n\nAs he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness\nand vacillation were resumed. For some time he followed closely a\nparty of some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one\ndropped off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy\nlane little frequented. The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed\nlost in thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly\na route which brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very\ndifferent from those we had hitherto traversed. It was the most noisome\nquarter of London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most\ndeplorable poverty, and of the most desperate crime. By the dim light\nof an accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were\nseen tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that\nscarce the semblance of a passage was discernible between them.\nThe paving-stones lay at random, displaced from their beds by the\nrankly-growing grass. Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters.\nThe whole atmosphere teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the\nsounds of human life revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands\nof the most abandoned of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro.\nThe spirits of the old man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near\nits death hour. Once more he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly\na corner was turned, a blaze of light burst upon our sight, and we stood\nbefore one of the huge suburban temples of Intemperance--one of the\npalaces of the fiend, Gin.\n\nIt was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still\npressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. With a half shriek of\njoy the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original\nbearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object,\namong the throng. He had not been thus long occupied, however, before\na rush to the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the\nnight. It was something even more intense than despair that I then\nobserved upon the countenance of the singular being whom I had watched\nso pertinaciously. Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with\na mad energy, retraced his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty\nLondon. Long and swiftly he fled, while I followed him in the wildest\namazement, resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an\ninterest all-absorbing. The sun arose while we proceeded, and, when we\nhad once again reached that most thronged mart of the populous town, the\nstreet of the D----- Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle\nand activity scarcely inferior to what I had seen on the evening before.\nAnd here, long, amid the momently increasing confusion, did I persist\nin my pursuit of the stranger. But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and\nduring the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that street. And,\nas the shades of the second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death,\nand, stopping fully in front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly\nin the face. He noticed me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I,\nceasing to follow, remained absorbed in contemplation. “This old man,” I\nsaid at length, “is the type and the genius of deep crime. He refuses to\nbe alone. [page 228:] He is the man of the crowd. It will be in vain to\nfollow; for I shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst\nheart of the world is a grosser book than the ‘Hortulus Animæ,’ {*1} and\nperhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ‘er lasst sich\nnicht lesen.’”\n\n","The world has turned and left me here.\nJust where I was before you appeared, and in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face.\n\nI just made love with your sweet memory one thousand times in my head.\nYou said you loved it more than ever.\n\nYou remain turned away, turning further every day.\n\nI talked for hours to your wallet photograph and you just listened.\nYou laughed enchanted by intellect, or maybe you didn't.\n\nYou remain turned away, turning further every day.\n\n","The sea is foaming like a bottle of beer.\nThe wave is coming but I ain't got no fear.\nI'm waxing down so that I'll go real fast.\nI'm waxing down because it's really a blast.\nI'm going surfin cos I don't like your face.\nI'm bailing out because I hate the race of rats that run round and round in the maze.\nI'm going surfing, I'm going surfing!\n\nYou take your car to work, I'll take my board.\nAnd when you're out of fuel, I'm still afloat.\n\nMy buddies and their honeys all come along.\nThey seem invincible as they surf along.\nThe sea is rolling like a thousand pound keg.\nWe're going surfing, we're going surfing!\n\nAll along the undertow is strengthening it's hold.\nI never thought it would come to this, now I can never go home.\n\n","\nPast drug experience: I started drinking and smoking my senior year of high school (I'm now a sophomore in college) and have done both on and off frequently. I've also done salvia 3 times, with very positive results, and mushrooms twice, also with very positive results, which made me get more interested in trying more drugs, such as acid and MDMA.\n\nMy roommate had mentioned earlier in the week that he was going to a rave this weekend, so I asked if he was rolling. When he said that he was, I asked if I could get in on that and he was very excited to include me in his rave group, which would now be 7 people, including both of us, with only one other person I knew. I had never been to a rave before and had never done ecstasy before, so I was both excited and nervous about the experience.\n\nI smoked almost two hours before we left, so I was still a little high when we piled into the car to drive to the rave. I was sitting in the trunk of an SUV with my roommate and the driver was driving (I thought) really fast and recklessly. This was starting to scare me, as I thought about how I wasn't wearing a seat belt because I was in the very back of the suv, about how we had drugs on us if we were pulled over for speeding (which he was) and about the fact that I was going to do a drug that I had never tried before and that could potentially have some negative effects.\n\nWe got to the warehouse that was hosting the rave and parked and all 7 of us took our first pill. This was at approximately 8:45 pm. My roommate and his friends already had their tickets to the rave so they found the presale line and entered, with my roommate telling me to call him once I got in. I found the line I needed, for people without tickets, which was extremely long and settled in to wait.\n\nAs the line moved slowly and I got closer to the entrance, (T + 0:30), I started getting more and more anxiety. There were cops driving by and occasionally shining lights in our direction, lots of noise and people running around, and it was a pretty sketchy looking area. They say setting is everything with drugs and at this moment, I wasn't comfortable alone where I was, I was worried about the effects of the drug and was pretty much convinced I would have a bad experience. I remember specifically thinking that I was stupid for doing this at night in a setting I didn't know, and regretting not doing this during the day, in my room where I would feel comfortable. I also noticed that I was swaying back and forth in line pretty consistently, and I started wondering if this was the ex setting in or if it was normal for me to sway back and forth while standing in one place for a long time.\n\nI finally got into the rave's outside area (there were 3 stages, one outside, a larger one inside, and another one on the other side of the inside stage) at T: + 0:45 and started to walk towards where my roommate told me to meet him. At this point, I noticed the first concrete effects of the dose starting to kick in: walking felt very weird, as though I could feel the air that I was moving through. There was almost a slight resistance to the air around me, like being underwater but subtler. It was not dissimilar to being high. I filed this away for later and met up with my roommate and his friends. We were sitting on the ground near the front outside stage, close enough to feel some vibrations from the subwoofers. I could not honestly tell you what kind of music was playing, but I think it's safe to say it was electronic or dance of some kind. It was danceable, that's all that's important.\n\nWe sat there for about 20 minutes relatively quietly as we slowly started to feel the effects of the initial dose (T+1:00). Someone, maybe me, maybe someone else, said something along the lines of 'I feel really good,' to which the rest of us all said, in unison 'Yeahhhhhh'. This continued for about 5 minutes, as each of us realized how GOOD we were all feeling. It was an incredible body high, the initial onset of the 'Ecstasy' that gives the drug its name: we just all felt so GOOD! Someone eventually had the bright idea to go dance to the music, which sounded like a really great idea at the time, and we moved to the dance floor.\n\nI'm not much of a dancer; I'm really too tall and awkward and uncoordinated to be a good dancer under normal or even alcohol-related conditions. But as we joined the growing number of people dancing in front of the outside stage, I didn't feel awkward or uncoordinated. All I felt was that growing body high and growing feeling of GOOD that was being fed and amplified by the music. And the MUSIC! Good god, this was IT! This was EXACTLY what I wanted to listen to right now! And the BASS! Wow!\n\nI probably said a lot of this out loud to my friends, who nodded and smiled and agreed with me. I was doing my usual nodding and swaying, which is typically as much dancing as I feel comfortable doing in public, and quickly progressing past it. I was really getting into this music and this dancing, and a quick look around assured me that everyone else was too and no one was even thinking about mocking my 'poor' dancing. I abandoned all self-consciousness about dancing from this point forward.\n\nAfter what seemed like a couple minutes, someone tapped me on the shoulder. It was Ashley, one of the girls in our group, the one besides my roommate that I knew before tonight. She motioned me to follow her out of the dance-area. Apparently, our group was taking a break. I was incredulous. We had just started dancing! And I was feeling so GOOD about dancing! Why would anyone want to stop dancing, even for a minute? And only minutes after we had started? Someone told me that it had been like 45 minutes. Oh. (T+1:45).\n\nI sat for maybe 5 minutes, bobbing my head and swaying to the music, which was getting pretty unfreakingbelievable, and then I heard a familiar noise. It was the opening sounds to 'Warp 1.9' by the Bloody Beetroots (the song that goes 'One! Two! Woop! Woop!' and then gets really heavy), which I absolutely love, especially when high. I immediately knew that this song would wreck me in my current state, and I HAD to dance to it. I informed the group that I was going to go dance some more and Ashley immediately grinned and stood up to follow me. She was right on my level (I got the sense that maybe a couple of the others were having some issues adjusting to the come-up process and the rolling itself, but I wasn't and I wanted to dance).\n\nThe song wrecked me. I lost my shit. I danced like I had never danced before. I texted my two closest friends that had rolled before (V and C), and told them what was up (the song and that I was rolling in general; V in particular had pushed me to try E and loved this song). I felt a sudden connection to them, because they had been exactly where I was now before and I understood where they were when they rolled. It's hard to put into words, but anyone who has rolled before will understand what I mean: when you're rolling, you want to ask people if they're rolling so that you can smile at them and they can smile back, because you are both in the same place and you both completely understand how the other feels at this moment. It's incredible.\n\nAt this point, I lose track of chronological order of things. I remember bits and pieces, but mostly I remember dancing. According to a text I sent to C, I took my second dose at around 10:45, which would be T+2:00, but time was a pretty fickle thing that night. I was still not at the peak of the first dose when I took the second (which I think is a good point to take another if you plan to, because then the peak of the first masks and hastens the come-up of the second) and I was feeling amazing at that point. I could have done anything. I loved everyone there. I could have hugged the world. It wasn't a sense of 'ecstasy' or straight up happiness like the name might imply; I wasn't quite euphoric or giddy with happiness (although that was a part of it and I was pretty happy). I just felt as good as I've ever felt in my life, physically, mentally and everything else. And I wanted to dance.\n\nI remember someone twirling glow sticks in someone's face, as the glow stick-ee watched in amazement. I stood next to them, watching the colors spiral and jump around and run in and out of one another. It was mind-blowing. He finished with them and started spinning in my face. I could have watched the light show for hours. He eventually moved on to someone else and I thanked him profusely.\n\nI remember moving inside to the big stage, which was crowded with people, all rolling, all dancing, all my new best friends. I instantly loved everyone there. I met a guy named 'Hoopy' and we instantly bonded over our shared rolling. We were exactly on each other's level. We exchanged names and phone numbers, because we already knew that we were friends.\n\nI went back and forth between the front outside stage and the main stage inside for a while, texting people while I walked. I told people that I loved them. I saw people wearing soft, fuzzy hats and I walked up to them and rubbed their hats. They smiled and stopped moving so that I could rub their hat for a few seconds until I smiled, hugged them, thanked them and moved on. One person's hat had fuzzy strings with a fuzzy poofball attached at the end hanging from the hat. I started to rub his hat and he took the fuzzy poofballs and rubbed my face and closed eyelids with them. It was mindblowing, the softest things I had ever felt.\n\nThere was some intensely dirty dubstep playing outside. I joined a circle of people going crazy near the stage. Every time a beat dropped, the circle would drop in unison, moving up and down to the slow, thunderous beat.\n\nI remember moving back inside for what I think was a large portion of the night. I took my shirt off and tucked it into my shorts at some point, because it was getting sweaty and the fans that were blowing felt amazing on my bare skin. I'm not a shirtless kind of guy in public, I normally think that guys who walk around shirtless in public look like douches, but that night, I knew that no one would judge me and that I wouldn't judge myself. This was a night for being free and abandoning everything to dance. Why wouldn't I be shirtless?\n\nI remember someone giving me a backrub. It was amazing enough for me to stop dancing for several minutes. I remember more glowsticks being twirled in my face. Someone had thrown really big balloon-like things into the crowd that would vibrate intensely with the beat. I pressed one against my face and felt the vibrations and it was unreal. Someone pressed one against my other check, so that my face was sandwiched between these two vibrating balloons. I could barely function. It was that intense and amazing.\n\nI remember having to swallow my gum while dancing because I had literally chewed it apart. Not 10 seconds later, someone tapped me on the shoulder and handed me a piece of gum. I turned and thanked them and asked how they knew, because gum was exactly what I needed right then. He just smiled at me.\n\nI remember eventually taking a piss break. I peed for like 40 seconds. I know this sounds weird, but it was literally the best piss I've ever taken. I remember telling my group this fact and they all agreed with me that peeing felt awesome.\n\nI remember not having a care in the world. I remember feeling like there was nothing bad or evil in the universe. I remember feeling like the entire universe was sending me good vibes. I remember feeling connected with every person that had ever rolled. I remember feeling in love with the 7 people in my rolling group, especially Ashley who I danced with for a lot of the night, and Justin because of his role (no pun intended) in bringing me to this wonderful place. I remember feeling in love with V and C. I remember being in love with everyone I knew.\n\nI remember other things too, but this is long enough already. Eventually the rave started to end and we left and returned home. I couldn't believe that I had spent almost 6 hours there, just dancing and feeling great. It felt like 15 minutes.\n\nI was still rolling, although I could tell that it was lessening, when I finally got back to my dorm. I looked at my eyes in the mirror and my pupils were incredibly dilated. I put on some music and had a one man dance party in my room. Eventually, I moved to my bed and just lay there, feeling the coolness of the AC, the softness of my sheets, and listening to the beautiful music. I lay there for a while before I eventually fell asleep.\n\nThe only negative effects the next day was the expected pain in my jaw from chewing gum way too hard all night and clenching my jaw. I'll have to invest in a mouthguard thingy next time. I was a little out of it all day, too. But no real hangover, which I was thankful for.\n\nI understand that people are cautious when it comes to certain drugs, and E is one of them. I can understand not wanting to try it because of worries about how it will affect you, not wanting to get addicted, not wanting to mess up your mind or whatever. That is all perfectly sound reasoning and I respect it. But it would make me happy if every person in my life that I loved tried E just once and had an experience as wonderful as mine. I want everyone I care about to feel as amazing as I did that night. I know this won't happen and can't happen, and I'm okay with that. But if I ever get a text from someone I know that reads like the ones I sent out that night ('Rolling. Rave. Love you.') then I will be incredibly happy.\n\n","\nI've never been a fan of Mother's Day or Father's Day. Everyone knows they are just a scam for the Greeting Card companies to make money. Yet my mother always thrusts guilt upon me if I don't get her a card and a nice little present to go with it. I know, I sound like a rotten son for saying it, but I get the card and the gifts solely that I do not feel the 'guilt' that goes otherwise. You see me and my parents do not see eye to eye on many issues, our indifferences causing a huge rift in our relationship with each other. One of many such indifferences which led me to experiencing the trip report I am writing about now. Don't get me wrong, I do love my parents dearly, but sometimes their overbearing love for me becomes a bit too much, and a little bit of escapism is needed. This was one of those nights, escapism inside the Mini Noodle.\n\nI won't go into much detail of what set off our usual bickering, basically it was at a family reunion in which I was accused of not spending enough time with the relatives. I tried defending myself, Mom got a little too worked up about it and brought up other degrading insults into the mix. I grew silent and endured the heated drive back home, where upon returning, I swiftly left in my car to get away. I went to a friend's place where a few of my buddies were lounging, smoking weed and drinking Coronas.\n\nThe laid back environment calmed me down significantly, and soon I forgot all about that afternoon, smoking a few bowls and watching a movie on Satellite t.v. My friends were good company, but unfortunately I am the only night owl in the group. I was able to keep my friends conscious until about 2 am, when they all agreed it was late and parted ways.\n\nI was still unwilling to go back home just yet, so I searched for another thing to do. I then remembered my connect and good friend 'T,' would be off work around 3:30. If I could just kill time until then, I could meet up with him and then sample some more of his latest supply inside the Mini Noodle.\n\nThe Mini Noodle was my sanctuary, a place to kick back and forget about the real world when the going got tough. It simply was an old shed placed out in my friend's backyard which was retrofitted with couches, blacklights and a cheap stereo. It was designed to resemble a chillout room from a rave where me and my friends could unwind and do our drugs. We could get fairly noisy out there and the neighbors wouldn't complain. My friend's neighbors had their own reasons for not wanting to attract the cops. Besides, it wasn't like we were out there every night anyway.\n\nThe chillroom was built so that we could throw a couple of our own mini-raves at the residence, but for the most part, it was still just a shed that held couches and some various paraphanelia, as well as some tagged glow in the dark paint on the walls. It got its name, the 'Mini Noodle,' through the rave venue where I had first met my friends. The Noodle Factory it was called, nestled around a few ghetto parts of West Oakland.\n\nI remembered helping my friends paint the shed when it was getting its new look, and the paint job resembled part of one of the rooms inside the Noodle Factory, which happened to be as cramped and hot as the shed we were painting. One of us pointed this fact out, and we lovingly christened its name, ironically, through our displeasure of partying at the stuffy Noodle Factory. I loved the Mini Noodle, it was my home away from home. Even when the mini-raves stopped happening, I would usually be out there at least once a weekend, smoking a bowl, huffing nitrous, listening to some music or popping a pill. I put that place to good use, and intended to do so again tonight.\n\nI managed spending the next hour and a half driving around aimlessly through town, getting food to eat and loitering outside a few places. I found my friend T outside the Sports Bar he worked at, picked him up and headed to my other friend's place that housed the Mini Noodle. He was my friend's brother, and was living with him at the time, so he was basically getting a free ride home. I asked if he had anymore of the stuff in his possession. He said yes. I smiled. Now for most people, unwinding with a smoke and a few beers would be enough. For me, I felt a little change was in order. I needed something new on the menu, and this time, Ecstacy and Ketamine were the special combo of the day.\n\nI still had a green music note leftover from a party two months ago. I had only done K once, and that was a few days ago when T had given me a free sample after scoring some from a rave he went too last week. It was nothing like I had ever tried before. This time, I wanted to see what K and E could do together. After all, it wasn't like Ketamine was easy to find in this town, so now that it was available, I might as well do some experimenting. T had done that combination before, but wasn't too impressed with it. But he was curious to see what it would do to me. So was I.\n\nI popped the green music note at 4. I normally wouldn't drop so late at night, but these circumstances called for it. I've had an experience with green music notes before. They wouldn't start working til an hour and a half after consumption, the longest I've ever waited for a pill to hit. But once they hit, they worked well, and would leave off some visuals once you came down.\n\nNaturally I wanted to wait an hour and a half before doing a bag of K, so that both drugs would be working in synch. After all, it only takes about 10 minutes for the disassociative effects of K to kick in, and lasts for about an hour. Yes, I had researched the drug fairly well, and timed the duration on my cell phone when I did it a few nights ago. So me and T chilled inside the Mini Noodle, all blacklights turned on, passing the bong back and forth smoking some mediocre weed and talking about parties past.\n\nAt 40 minutes past T could not wait any longer. He pulled out a small red baggie and a cut straw and snorted up the premeasured 100 mg of ketamine hydrochloride inside. He sighed in delight and passed another bag and the straw to me, but I refused. My roll wasn't kicking in yet, I was only stoned and tired, but I was also growing anxious. Just my luck to be left with one pill that took so ridiculously long to hit. T laughed and played some Happy Hardcore. Not my type of music to listen too when taking a disassociative/psychedelic, I much prefer progressive house or psytrance during a trip, but it seemed to make T feel much more at home. I wasn't going to argue this time. I loved happy hardcore when I was rolling anyway, and hopefully I will be rolling soon.\n\n50 minutes past and still nothing but baked thoughts and a slight urge to dance. I had still been talking to T about various things, but the last question he answered, he seemed to get stuck, and stared at me for a few minutes before laughing. I could tell the K was getting hold of him, and I wanted to stay somewhere around his level. So when he offered me the bag and straw the second time around, I took it willingly.\n\nI emptied the bag at 4:50 with just a few strong whiffs, feeling like a disco stud. K goes up the nostrils so much smoother than cocaine. There's no numbness, no breathing out of only one nostril, just a slight tingle to it and it's gone. I poked my finger in the bag, gathered a few more particles and rubbed it on my gums. There was no significance to it, I was only being silly. It got a few more disjointed laughs from T.\n\n5 minutes later he gets up, and wobbles over to the couch to lie down. I say wobble, because walking becomes difficult once K works its magic. It's much better to lie down anyway, because having to stand can become quite distracting from the trip. At 5 am I found myself getting stuck as well. Basically it's just looking around the room and having my vision stop at one random place for a few minutes before I realize I've been staring at nothing for...how long? It becomes difficult telling time too. I could now feel the room slowly start to tilt from side to side, as if a giant was outside the Mini Noodle, rocking the place back and forth.\n\nI get up out of my chair and wave my arms in the air, struggling for balance. My spinal cord refuses to snap upright, so I wobble over to my couch, hunchbacked. I glance over to my right and T is already K'ed out, rocking out to the cheesy riffs of the hardcore. I drop on my couch like dead weight, rocking my head back and forth, becoming amazed at how heavy it feels. And there we lie, on our respective couches, for the next 40 minutes. I check my cellphone here and there to check the time, but soon the LED panel becomes too bright for me to read the display. So I lie there doing nothing, zoning in and out and having scattered thoughts that I forget about a few minutes after.\n\nAt 5:30 T gets up to change cd's with another happy hardcore album. He seems to be fairly sober now, and takes another rip out of the bong once the new cd plays. I'm coming out of my K trip as well, with nothing remarkable to really remember, much to my disappointment. Just as I thought, I had taken the K too early, and now I started to feel my jaw tighten up and the familiar MDMA-induced feelings tingle around my mind and body. Life can be so cruel sometimes, or can it? I turn to look at T with a slight smirk on my face, and ask him, 'Want to go halves on another bag?' T never hesitated.\n\n5:35 am, me and T take in another 50 mg (roughly) of our beloved substance. Neither one of us had fully comedown off the first bump yet, so there would still be some K running in our system as the 2nd bump came in. Before I lose my ability to walk again, I cache out what was left in the bong then promptly return to my seat. The E was coming on quite nicely, but the jaw clench was slightly distracting. If only I had some gum to chew. There was a half-full bottle of Aquafina on the table, so I drink some of that to keep myself hydrated.\n\n10 minutes later I'm wobbling back over to the couch Notre Dame style, this time noticing a difference in the intensity of the influence. My body had become dead weight again, but this time I had much more feeling. I could feel the individual hairs on my arms nestle around, and the itchy fabric of the couch had become softer, I could now feel all the different fibers rest around my skin. How strange it was, to feel all your muscles in your body become 10 times heavier, and yet have elevated feelings in touch.\n\n20 minutes after the 2nd K bump go by, and I can feel my body start to sweat a little. I try pulling my cell phone out to look at the time again, and I see that my phone had bent in an arc to the right. I now had to tilt my head to read the display, and even then my mind couldn't make sense of what it read. It looked familiar, but distant, unimportant. I throw the phone somewhere on the couch and run my fingers through my hair. Oh God, did it feel good, even though my hair felt more like a cheap wig, it still felt good to touch it.\n\nI look up at the ceiling, and all the normal pock marks and scratches are slowly moving forward. It became more like a conveyor belt than a ceiling, as the dents and marks would move forward, then disappear somehow, and come back to its original place, moving forward again. Soon the dents and marks began forming shapes of their own, moving on this upside down conveyor belt. I began to feel like Alice, plummeting down the rabbit hole, and as soon as I thought that, behold! A half visible face of the Cheshire Cat appeared to me, running along the conveyor belt. And as soon as I gasped in surprise, Cheshire grinned at me, before disappearing. Oh my God, it was happening. I was tripping out!\n\nI soon took my focus out of the conveyor belt ceiling, and looked around all the tagged, glow in the dark art covering the walls. It was all mostly neon green, but I saw that the letters were taking on a Life of their own. They were becoming 3-D. They could bend and twist around. They could stretch and shrink. They wanted to move, and this time the natural laws of the Earth couldn't stop them. The dancing letters became pleasant to look at, and I could feel my eyes rolling back in their sockets as the letters darted back and forth across the walls.\n\nThey started moving across the walls and floor so quickly that soon I became convinced that I was stuck inside the Matrix and could see all the green code scrolling by. It was a lightshow like no other, and I was loving it. Here and there I would try to grab one of the letters as they passed by, but my arms would not work right. It kept feeling like they would grow out 20 feet in length, and then I would have a hard time trying to ravel it back to its original length, much like winding up a garden hose. It was too weird of a feeling so I dropped them back on the couch in defeat.\n\nI looked back up at the ceiling to marvel at the Matrix code, but it had disappeared. The letters had gone back to their original places, but they looked foreign, I could still not understand what they read. I saw a little black speck walk across one of the letters, it looked like a small spider. As soon as I thought that, a giant glimmering silver web filled across my vision, and to my surprise, a silky strand of webbing had attached itself on every object in the room, including me. Seeing as I hate spiders, I did what I could to remove the strand of webbing off of myself, as hard as that was to do.\n\nAs soon as it left me, I felt a cold shock run through my body, as if I had been cut off from something vital. I began wondering if perhaps that what I saw was the Web of Life, and everything alive was attached to it, and to be cut off from it could only mean death. No that doesn't make sense. I am tripping, that is all. The air condensed all around me. The light bounced off the air in strange ways, making the air appear solid. What kind of solid reflects light in that way? Glass. Oh no, the air has turned into glass! I am suffocating! I could no longer breathe. All I could feel were sharp pieces of glass ripping into my lungs.\n\nHow could this have happened? There is no glass, you are tripping. Somehow, as chemically altered as my senses were, there was still this tiny, sane voice in my mind, reminding me of what I had taken. As soon as I remembered that I had taken K, the air became normal again. But as poor as my short term memory was that night, I would forget the voice, and start seeing things again.\n\nThe happy hardcore still playing in the background now sounded like it was slowed down, like it had become trance instead. The layers of sound in the tracks were no longer in synch, and so parts of the song would sound off. One lyric sprung into my mind, 'Jump onto your feet,' That sounded like a good idea. But how did one, jump onto their feet? That required movement of some sort right? Movement that I could no longer make. I still wanted to dance to the music, but I couldn't figure how to go about that anymore. Perhaps, if gravity offered a little assistance.\n\nAnd that's when the world tilted. I felt suddenly as if the couch had attached its bottom end onto the left wall and there was all this gravity that was now pushing on my left side, wanting me to fall on the floor, and yet somehow there I remained, glued onto the couch which was now glued onto the wall. And from there, fabrics began appearing everywhere. Various multi-patterned fabrics, as if they had been ripped from some larger material and were now being draped and layered together in random places.\n\nSoon the fabrics were everywhere, polka dots, stripes, labrynth shapes, and others in various degrees of opacity, forming a huge fabric montage in front of my very eyes. I didn't know what the Hell was going on anymore. And when it looked like I would now be suffocated from pounds of fabrics thrown on my body, everything went back to normal. The couch was back on the floor, the glow in the dark art was understandable once again, everything was back in its place. I must have blacked out.\n\nThe hardcore cd had ended and T seemed to have fallen asleep. I still felt very much cracked out and tired, and my jaw ached. I searched around the couch and find my phone. The display read 7:14 am. Wow, it was already morning. I was too tired to drive home, and too cracked out to sleep, so I laid there on the couch, for another hour, thinking of the things I had just experienced. Gradually I'm able to sleep again.\n\nAfter that night I decided to stay away from the Special K for a little while. I had read about its psychedelic effects, and after trying acid and shrooms, I knew I wanted to give this drug a shot. It did not disappoint, it was so radically different from the other psychedelics, it still amazes me to recall the things I saw inside the Mini Noodle that night. Not that I could discern any enlightenment from it, but an interesting experience nonetheless. Just one of many late nights, in the Mini Noodle. Oh yes, and I did get around to giving my mom her gift and card for Mother's Day. Business as usual. \n\n","\nIn the internal decoration, if not in the external architecture of\ntheir residences, the English are supreme. The Italians have but little\nsentiment beyond marbles and colours. In France, _meliora probant,\ndeteriora _sequuntur--the people are too much a race of gadabouts to\nmaintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a\ndelicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The\nChinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate\nfancy. The Scotch are _poor _decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an\nindeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain they are\n_all _curtains--a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The\nHottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone\nare preposterous.\n\nHow this happens, it is not difficult to see. We have no aristocracy of\nblood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable\nthing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the _display\nof wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the\nheraldic display in monarchical countries. By a transition readily\nunderstood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been\nbrought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself.\n\nTo speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere parade\nof costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create\nan impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances\nthemselves--or of taste as regards the proprietor:--this for the reason,\nfirst, that wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition\nas constituting a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility\nof blood, confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste,\nrather avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu\n_rivalry may at any time be successfully attempted.\n\nThe people _will _imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough\ndiffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being\nthe sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general,\nto be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace,\nlooking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two\nentirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost\nof an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly\nthe sole test of its merit in a decorative point of view--and this test,\nonce established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily\ntraceable to the one primitive folly.\n\nThere could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist\nthan the interior of what is termed in the United States--that is to\nsay, in Appallachia--a well-furnished apartment. Its most usual defect\nis a want of keeping. We speak of the keeping of a room as we would of\nthe keeping of a picture--for both the picture and the room are amenable\nto those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of art; and\nvery nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits of a\npainting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber.\n\nA want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the\nseveral pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of\nadaptation to use _Very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic\narrangement. Straight lines are too prevalent--too uninterruptedly\ncontinued--or clumsily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines\noccur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision,\nthe appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.\n\nCurtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other\ndecorations. With formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an\nextensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance,\nirreconcilable with good taste--the proper quantum, as well as the\nproper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect.\n\nCarpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we\nstill very frequently err in their patterns and colours. The soul of the\napartment is the carpet. From it are deduced not only the hues but the\nforms of all objects incumbent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary\nman; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius. Yet we have heard\ndiscoursing of carpets, with the air “_d’un mouton qui reve,” _fellows\nwho should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of\ntheir own _moustaches. _Every one knows that a large floor _may _have a\ncovering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering\nof small--yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. As\nregards texture, the Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the\npreterpluperfect tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying\nagonies. Touching pattern--a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like\na Riccaree Indian--all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. In\nbrief--distinct grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, _of\nno meaning, _are here Median laws. The abomination of flowers, or\nrepresentations of well-known objects of any kind, should not be\nendured within the limits of Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets,\nor curtains, or tapestry, or ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this\nnature should be rigidly Arabesque. As for those antique floor-cloth &\nstill occasionally seen in the dwellings of the rabble--cloths of huge,\nsprawling, and radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious\nwith all hues, among which no ground is intelligible--these are but the\nwicked invention of a race of time-servers and money-lovers--children\nof Baal and worshippers of Mammon--Benthams, who, to spare thought\nand economize fancy, first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope, and then\nestablished joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam.\n\n _Glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of American household\ndecoration--an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion of\ntaste just specified., We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass.\nThe former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady\nlight offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild,\nor what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows,\nwill do wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more\nlovely thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course,\nthe astral lamp proper--the lamp of Argand, with its original plain\nground-glass shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The\ncut-glass shade is a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with\nwhich we have adopted it, partly on account of its _flashiness,_ but\nprincipally on account of its _greater rest,_ is a good commentary on\nthe proposition with which we began. It is not too much to say, that the\ndeliberate employer of a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient\nin taste, or blindly subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light\nproceeding from one of these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and\npainful. It alone is sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the\nfurniture subjected to its influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is\nmore than one-half disenchanted beneath its evil eye.\n\nIn the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. Its\nleading feature is _glitter--_and in that one word how much of all that\nis detestable do we express! Flickering, unquiet lights, are _sometimes\n_pleasing--to children and idiots always so--but in the embellishment\nof a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth, even strong\n_steady _lights are inadmissible. The huge and unmeaning glass\nchandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle in\nour most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of\nall that is false in taste or preposterous in folly.\n\nThe rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before\nobserved, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract--has\nled us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. We line our\ndwellings with great British plates, and then imagine we have done a\nfine thing. Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince\nany one who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous\nlooking-glasses, and especially of large ones. Regarded apart from\nits reflection, the mirror presents a continuous, flat, colourless,\nunrelieved surface,--a thing always and obviously unpleasant. Considered\nas a reflector, it is potent in producing a monstrous and odious\nuniformity: and the evil is here aggravated, not in merely direct\nproportion with the augmentation of its sources, but in a ratio\nconstantly increasing. In fact, a room with four or five mirrors\narranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show, a room of\nno shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter upon\nglitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing\neffects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,\nwould be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be\naltogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let\nthe same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be\nstartled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.\n\nIt is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a\nman of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in\nit. The corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the\ndollar-manufacture. As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is,\ntherefore, not among _our _aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in\nAppallachia), for the spirituality of a British _boudoir. _But we have\nseen apartments in the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly “modest”\n or “moderate”] means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with\nany of the _or-molu’d _cabinets of our friends across the water. Even\n_now_, there is present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious\nchamber with whose decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor\nlies asleep on a sofa--the weather is cool--the time is near midnight:\nwe will make a sketch of the room during his slumber.\n\nIt is oblong--some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth--a\nshape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of\nfurniture. It has but one door--by no means a wide one--which is at one\nend of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the\nother. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor--have deep\nrecesses--and open on an Italian _veranda. _Their panes are of a\ncrimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than\nusual. They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue\nadapted to the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small\nvolumes. Without the recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson\nsilk, fringed with a deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue,\nwhich is the material of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but\nthe folds of the whole fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and\nhave an airy appearance), issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich\ngiltwork, which encircles the room at the junction of the ceiling and\nwalls. The drapery is thrown open also, or closed, by means of a thick\nrope of gold loosely enveloping it, and resolving itself readily into\na knot; no pins or other such devices are apparent. The colours of\nthe curtains and their fringe--the tints of crimson and gold--appear\neverywhere in profusion, and determine the _character _of the room. The\ncarpet--of Saxony material--is quite half an inch thick, and is of the\nsame crimson ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord\n(like that festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface\nof the _ground, _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a\nsuccession of short irregular curves--one occasionally overlaying the\nother. The walls are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint,\nspotted with small Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent\ncrimson. Many paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly\nlandscapes of an imaginative cast--such as the fairy grottoes of\nStanfield, or the lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There\nare, nevertheless, three or four female heads, of an ethereal\nbeauty-portraits in the manner of Sully. The tone of each picture is\nwarm, but dark. There are no “brilliant effects.” _Repose _speaks in\nall. Not one is of small size. Diminutive paintings give that _spotty\n_look to a room, which is the blemish of so many a fine work of Art\novertouched. The frames are broad but not deep, and richly carved,\nwithout being _dulled _or filagreed. They have the whole lustre of\nburnished gold. They lie flat on the walls, and do not hang off with\ncords. The designs themselves are often seen to better advantage in this\nlatter position, but the general appearance of the chamber is injured.\nBut one mirror--and this not a very large one--is visible. In shape it\nis nearly circular--and it is hung so that a reflection of the person\ncan be obtained from it in none of the ordinary sitting-places of the\nroom. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson silk, gold-flowered,\nform the only seats, with the exception of two light conversation\nchairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood, also),\nwithout cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed altogether of\nthe richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the sofas. This\nis also without cover--the drapery of the curtains has been thought\nsufficient.. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which bloom a\nprofusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded angles\nof the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with\nhighly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend.\nSome light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson\nsilk cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently\nbound books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except\nan Argand lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which\ndepends from He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain,\nand throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all.\n\n","My friend and I's first experience with acid happened May 12 of 2006. We had just gotten out of school so we figured hey, lets get some acid. We'd both done shrooms a couple of times before but that was it for hallucinogens.\n\n7:30AM - we had only gotten a couple of hours of sleep the night before (anticipation) and decided we'd go to the local waffle house for a nice breakfast of Acid and water :) We put the fat blue-stained tabs on our tongues on the way and got our semi-retarded but sober friend to drive us there. Our first indications of anything different were probably about an hour after the drop at the waffle house. With the tabs still on our tongues, we decided to swallow them with water at our table. My friend looked down at a spoon that was next to me and said 'Oh fuck' because my face was starting to 'transform'. I didn't notice any change until we got up to leave, when suddenly I felt really unnaturally tall. The ground was kind of slanted and colors took on a brighter, more vivid effect.\n\nThen it happened. As we got into the car, we went into neverland. All of a sudden it had the effect of a mild mushroom trip and we decided to head for my friend's house because his parents were out. By the time we arrived, it was really starting to hit. Nothing freaked us out at this point even though neither of us had experienced as intense a thing as this before. Once inside, the hallucinations started happening. My first one I'll never forget was lookin at a statue on the mantle and watching it transform into a serpant and slither around. My friend started talkin to the horse head picture on the wall - he said it was pokin out and talking to him. Every aspect of the room seemed to be alive and in its own universe.\n\nOur other friend/sitter decided to go out on the porch and smoke a joint while we continued trippin our balls off. Next stage of the trip, the bathroom. I walked in to take a piss and before I was able to turn on the lights, I had the most intense, realistic hallucinations of people and character's faces coming at me through the darkness. I yelled at my friend to get in there and he saw igniting sparks flying around his head. While our friend was blazing outside we went into the basement to attempt to play pool. HAHAHA. Right. We ended up hunting giraffes on a safari thinkin the pool cue's were spears. Our other sober friend came downstairs and I tried talking to him but I kept seeing things manifest from his face, mainly banana-stalks and images of fruit.\n\nMy trippin friend had left the room to go watch his countertop 'breathe' so I took the opportunity to stick my head into the freezer. Man the images I saw, I can't even describe it. Eventually all 4 of us wound up upstairs and then all hell broke loose. Our beautiful experience was about to turn into a hellish nightmare by the call of one person, my friend's dad. Apparently his dad chose this day of all days to hound his ass on the phone about him not coming home the night before and fully expecting him to be home in a couple of hours. Now we were in trouble - we had planned to stay the entire trip at his house and we had to leave. As if it weren't enough, our friends both bailed on us and so there we were, 2 acid heads outside watching our friends drive away and trying to figure out what to do with poolsticks in our hands.\n\nAfter an eternity of panic (2 real minutes) I called my other friend and told him our situation. We convinced him to drive down and babysit us, so again we were good for about another hour until my friend's dad started calling again. No way could he have talked to him on the phone, we were so far gone from reality at this point that nothing, not even 4 word text messages made sense to us. So began our grand journey. We got our friend to drive us to the local park so we could walk around. We were so fucked up that our only goal was to kill time until we could come down to reality and face society again.\n\nAs soon as we were on the walking/bike path, we noticed our first heavy tracers when bikers would go by and their doubles would keep passing us for another 2 minutes. The jungle had never looked so alive. Everything was moving and breathing, and I think this is where sounds started to mesh with sight and taste. I remember 'tasting' the green of the leaves and hearing the trails of the bikers. Well that lasted about 5 minutes real time (3 hours ours) so we told our friend to drive us anywhere else, which ended up being another park. When we stopped in the parking lot we met another friend who freaked us the fuck out. He kept saying he had a friend who was a sheriff and he was gonna get us arrested and into a drug program.\n\nSo then all of us went to this pizza joint and ordered a large pepperoni. My friend's distorted image of the waitress was beyond ridiculous, he said 'When she put the pizza on the table her face went with it and landed in the middle of the cheese.' By now people's faces were melting and shape-shifting, it was nearly impossible to talk to people, or so we thought, apparently we sounded fine the whole time but we sure as hell didn't feel like we did. There was pizza in front of us and we just couldn't eat - just too fucked up, so its about hour 5 or 6 with no food. Next we, in our brilliancy, decided it would be smart to try to go to a movie just to pass the time. This was the dumbest thing we've ever done. On the way to the theater we happened to see a live car accident as it happened (confirmed by our sober friends), and as if that weren't enough all the times and titles on the theater listings were backwards in real life, which just made us feel more crazier.\n\nBy now we started to get worried that the trip wouldn't end - that's where the panic started. When we walked into the theater, we thought we saw a crowded room with people in every seat, then our friend told us there was only one lady in the very back and suddenly we saw how empty it was. This made us just lose it. The sound meshing of the theater's bass mixed with our howling screams (at the previews) was too much to take. As my friend was busy watching the spindles of light manifest and rotate about the movie screen, I went into the deepest meditative state I've ever been in my life. My eyes were crosseyed and I literally saw what I'd call the spindles of consciousness. Two spinning fibrous greenish tornado beings is the best I can do to describe it. All the while my friend was too freaked out to sit still and started yelling at me in my ear. It sounded like he was a hundred miles away, I could barely hear him I was so far in my own mind. So our sober friend quickly ushered us out and back in the car, 20 dollars wasted on a movie where we didn't even make it past the 3rd preview.\n\nWe went to another friend's house who had just gotten home from school and her parents were gone. We tried hookin up the xbox and playin some halo2, I think I got 26 suicides while seriously trying to play and my friend kept dropping the controller and staring at the ceiling. And then outa nowhere her mom walked in. I can't even tell you the panic. Somehow we talked to her for a few minutes and she left, and then we went outside to the tire swing. This was def. one of the best and scariest parts of the trip. We had our friends wind us up and spin us on the swing, and when we opened our eyes it was like total mind-meltdown, I couldn't even tell you what planet I was on.\n\nSo even longer story short, night came and we were about 14 hours into the trip and still hardcore tripping, I mean tracers and hallucinations, no sign of a comedown. This is what freaked us out the most, everywhere we read had said 12 hours max and we were fucked beyond yesterday. We panicked cause we both were supposed to be home at certain times and we had to get our sober friends to write text messages to our parents telling them we were out for the night. Our best idea at the time was to tell our parents the next day we had been wasted cause anything would be better than them finding out we did acid.\n\n9:45pm and only a small hint of a comedown. our friend said she'd drive us to a local pharmacy and get us some herbal shit. It was supposed to 'detox' us or somethin but we both knew it was bullshit and we couldn't remember how to swallow pills anyway so we stuffed em in our pockets and pretended to take them. When we got back to her house we were way freaking out and decided it was up to us to learn how to 'reintegrate into society'. We tried immitating the other 'humans' aka non-acid-takers we saw in her house by eating muffins and playing cards. That lasted 20 seconds, we were too fucked to tell what our cards were or understand any purpose of the game.\n\n11pm still trippin and we have our original friend from the morning pick us up and take us to his house to crash for the night. In the meantime we had talked to dogs, plotted a genius escape by making our caretakers think we had disappeared and killed each other, and watched the most beautiful sunset you could possibly imagine.\n\nSo back at the house we attempted to go to sleep. 2 in the morning and we knew we were coming down but we still weren't sure when the hell it was all gonna be over. We had told our friend to sleep in the room with us in case his mom would have come down or something but that lazy mullet-haired water-head down syndrom son of a bitch said he wanted to sleep upstairs and that he'd be back in the morning. So after he leaves, we freak out for the last time of the trip and take it upon ourselves to create a 'fake friend' for our comfort lol. We put covers over a bunch of pillows to make it look like someone was asleep on the sofa and for whatever reason it just worked, totally reassured us for the rest of the night.\n\nAbout 4am and we were in and out of sleep, still really restless from almost 20 hours of non-stop tripping and NOTHING to eat all day. The tv was on but anytime we'd see human faces it would just freak us out and remind us how not normal we were, so we put it on the golf channel (and we HATE golf) all night just because there wasn't anything to horrific about watching a ball cross a green. After what seemed to be nine eternities (literally watching the seconds of the clock for hours) we somehow slept for a couple hours and awoke in the morning.\n\nVisuals had returned to normal but the lingering psychosis was still there, we just didn't feel like ourselves. We felt in some way detatched and we didn't think we were ready to go back into society. But we went our separate ways and that was that, followed by the next two days of reintegration. Things and thoughts became normal but it was an agonizingly slow process. The first time I talked to my mom the day after the trip I almost puked I was so nervous, but I sounded fine on the outside.\n\n","Yeah lyn and yx.","\nA molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term molecule is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions.\n\nIn the kinetic theory of gases, the term molecule is often used for any gaseous particle regardless of its composition. According to this definition, noble gas atoms are considered molecules as they are monatomic molecules.\n\nA molecule may be homonuclear, that is, it consists of atoms of one chemical element, as with oxygen (O 2 ); or it may be heteronuclear, a chemical compound composed of more than one element, as with water (H 2 O). Atoms and complexes connected by non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds, are typically not considered single molecules.\n\nMolecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and therefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the crust, mantle, and core of the Earth, contain many chemical bonds, but are not made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for ionic crystals (salts) and covalent crystals (network solids), although these are often composed of repeating unit cells that extend either in a plane (such as in graphene) or three-dimensionally (such as in diamond, quartz, or sodium chloride). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with metallic bonding, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In glasses (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.\n\nThe science of molecules is called molecular chemistry or molecular physics, depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of chemical bonds, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system (bound state) composed of two or more atoms. Polyatomic ions may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term unstable molecule is used for very reactive species, i.e., short-lived assemblies (resonances) of electrons and nuclei, such as radicals, molecular ions, Rydberg molecules, transition states, van der Waals complexes, or systems of colliding atoms as in Bose–Einstein condensate.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster and the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word \"molecule\" derives from the Latin \"moles\" or small unit of mass.* Molecule (1794) – \"extremely minute particle\", from French ' (1678), from New Latin ', diminutive of Latin  \"mass, barrier\". A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the word (used until the late 18th century only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of Descartes.\n\nThe definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest particles of pure chemical substances that still retain their composition and chemical properties. This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as rocks, salts, and metals, are composed of large crystalline networks of chemically bonded atoms or ions, but are not made of discrete molecules.\n\nMolecules are held together by either covalent bonding or ionic bonding. Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule. A molecule of a compound is made out of two or more elements.\n\nCovalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. These electron pairs are termed shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed covalent bonding.\n\n\n\nIonic bonding is a type of chemical bond that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, and is the primary interaction occurring in ionic compounds. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more electrons (termed cations) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed anions). This transfer of electrons is termed electrovalence in contrast to covalence. In the simplest case, the cation is a metal atom and the anion is a nonmetal atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH 4 + or SO 4  2−. Basically, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.\n\nMost molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, although molecules of many polymers can reach macroscopic sizes, including biopolymers such as DNA. Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few angstroms (Å) to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by light (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an atomic force microscope. Some of the largest molecules are macromolecules or supermolecules.\n\nThe smallest molecule is the diatomic hydrogen (H 2 ), with a bond length of 0.74 Å.\n\nEffective molecular radius is the size a molecule displays in solution. The table of permselectivity for different substances contains examples.\n\n\n\nThe chemical formula for a molecule uses one line of chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and plus (+) and minus (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.\n\nA compound's empirical formula is a very simple type of chemical formula. It is the simplest integer ratio of the chemical elements that constitute it. For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms, and ethyl alcohol or ethanol is always composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely – dimethyl ether has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same atoms in different arrangements are called isomers. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.\n\nThe molecular formula reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.\n\nThe empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule acetylene has molecular formula C 2 H 2, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.\n\nThe molecular mass can be calculated from the chemical formula and is expressed in conventional atomic mass units equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 ( 12 C isotope) atom. For network solids, the term formula unit is used in stoichiometric calculations.\n\n\n\nFor molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural chemical formula may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a structural formula may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such chemical nomenclature requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.\n\n\n\nMolecules have fixed equilibrium geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its reactivity. Isomers share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. Stereoisomers, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different biochemical activities.\n\n\n\nMolecular spectroscopy deals with the response (spectrum) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known energy (or frequency, according to Planck's formula). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through absorbance or emission. Spectroscopy does not generally refer to diffraction studies where particles such as neutrons, electrons, or high energy X-rays interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).\n\nMicrowave spectroscopy commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. Infrared spectroscopy measures the vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or functional groups in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or near infrared light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.\n\nThe study of molecules by molecular physics and theoretical chemistry is largely based on quantum mechanics and is essential for the understanding of the chemical bond. The simplest of molecules is the hydrogen molecule-ion, H 2 +, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the one-electron bond. H 2 + is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schrödinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of computational chemistry.\n\nWhen trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is sufficiently stable to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it \"must correspond to a depression on the potential energy surface that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state\". This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the helium dimer, He 2, which has one vibrational bound state and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures.\n\nWhether or not an arrangement of atoms is sufficiently stable to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an elementary particle); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.\n\n","Article 1401: Scope and Coverage\n1.

Subject to Annex 1403.3, at such time as the United States permits commercial banks of another Party located in its territory to expand through subsidiaries or direct branches into substantially all of the United States market, the Parties shall review and assess market access provided by each Party in relation to the principles in paragraphs 1 and 2 with a view to adopting arrangements permitting investors of another Party to choose the juridical form of establishment of commercial banks.\n4. Each Party shall permit an investor of another Party that does not own or control a financial institution in the Party's territory to establish a financial institution in that territory. A Party may:\n\n(a) require an investor of another Party to incorporate under the Party's law any financial institution it establishes in the Party's territory; or\n(b) impose terms and conditions on establishment that are consistent with Article 1405.\n5. For purposes of this Article, \"investor of another Party\" means an investor of another Party engaged in the business of providing financial services in the territory of that Party.\nArticle 1404: Cross-Border Trade\n1. No Party may adopt any measure restricting any type of cross-border trade in financial services by cross-border financial service providers of another Party that the Party permits on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, except to the extent set out in Section B of the Party's Schedule to Annex VII.\n2. Each Party shall permit persons located in its territory, and its nationals wherever located, to purchase financial services from cross-border financial service providers of another Party located in the territory of that other Party or of another Party. This obligation does not require a Party to permit such providers to do business or solicit in its territory. Subject to paragraph 1, each Party may define \"doing business\" and \"solicitation\" for purposes of this obligation.\n3. Without prejudice to other means of prudential regulation of cross-border trade in financial services, a Party may require the registration of cross-border financial service providers of another Party and of financial instruments.\n4. The Parties shall consult on future liberalization of cross-border trade in financial services as set out in Annex 1404.4.\nArticle 1405: National Treatment\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own investors, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments in financial institutions in its territory.\n2. Each Party shall accord to financial institutions of another Party and to investments of investors of another Party in financial institutions treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial institutions and to investments of its own investors in financial institutions, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments.\n3. Subject to Article 1404, where a Party permits the cross-border provision of a financial service it shall accord to the cross-border financial service providers of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial service providers, in like circumstances, with respect to the provision of such service.\n4. The treatment that a Party is required to accord under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 means, with respect to a measure of any state or province:\n\n(a) in the case of an investor of another Party with an investment in a financial institution, an investment of such investor in a financial institution, or a financial institution of such investor, located in a state or province, treatment no less favorable than the treatment accorded to an investor of the Party in a financial institution, an investment of such investor in a financial institution, or a financial institution of such investor, located in that state or province, in like circumstances; and\n(b) in any other case, treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded to an investor of the Party in a financial institution, its financial institution or its investment in a financial institution, in like circumstances.\nFor greater certainty, in the case of an investor of another Party with investments in financial institutions or financial institutions of such investor, located in more than one state or province, the treatment required under subparagraph (a) means:\n\n(c) treatment of the investor that is no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded to an investor of the Party with an investment located in such states, or provinces in like circumstances; and\n(d) with respect to an investment of the investor in a financial institution or a financial institution of such investor, located in a state or province, treatment no less favorable than that accorded to an investment of an investor of the Party, or a financial institution of such investor, located in that state or province, in like circumstances.\n5. A Party's treatment of financial institutions and cross-border financial service providers of another Party, whether different or identical to that accorded to its own institutions or providers in like circumstances, is consistent with paragraphs 1 through 3 if the treatment affords equal competitive opportunities.\n6. A Party's treatment affords equal competitive opportunities if it does not disadvantage financial institutions and cross-border financial services providers of another Party in their ability to provide financial services as compared with the ability of the Party's own financial institutions and financial services providers to provide such services, in like circumstances.\n7. Differences in market share, profitability or size do not in themselves establish a denial of equal competitive opportunities, but such differences may be used as evidence regarding whether a Party's treatment affords equal competitive opportunities.\nArticle 1406: Most-Favored-Nation Treatment\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, financial institutions of another Party, investments of investors in financial institutions and cross-border financial service providers of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to the investors, financial institutions, investments of investors in financial institutions and cross-border financial service providers of any other Party or of a non-Party, in like circumstances.\n2. A Party may recognize prudential measures of another Party or of a non-Party in the application of measures covered by this Chapter. Such recognition may be:\n\n(a) accorded unilaterally;\n(b) achieved through harmonization or other means; or\n(c) based upon an agreement or arrangement with the other Party or non-Party.\n3. A Party according recognition of prudential measures under paragraph 2 shall provide adequate opportunity to another Party to demonstrate that circumstances exist in which there are or would be equivalent regulation, oversight, implementation of regulation, and if appropriate, procedures concerning the sharing of information between the Parties.\n4.

He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes\nhe had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his\nsword-hilt.\n\nHe was very much admired indeed.  “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,”\nremarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for\nhaving artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing\nlest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\n\n“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible mother of her\nlittle boy who was crying for the moon.  “The Happy Prince never dreams\nof crying for anything.”\n\n“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a\ndisappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\n\n“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out\nof the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white\npinafores.\n\n“How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen\none.”\n\n“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the\nMathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not\napprove of children dreaming.\n\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had\ngone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was\nin love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring\nas he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so\nattracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\n\n“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at\nonce, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her,\ntouching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was\nhis courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\n“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has\nno money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite\nfull of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.\n\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.\n“She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a\ncoquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.”  And certainly,\nwhenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  “I\nadmit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my\nwife, consequently, should love travelling also.”\n\n“Will you come away with me?” he said finally to her; but the Reed shook\nher head, she was so attached to her home.\n\n“You have been trifling with me,” he cried.  “I am off to the Pyramids.\nGood-bye!” and he flew away.\n\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  “Where\nshall I put up?” he said; “I hope the town has made preparations.”\n\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\n\n“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of\nfresh air.”  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\n\n“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round,\nand he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under\nhis wing a large drop of water fell on him.  “What a curious thing!” he\ncried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear\nand bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is\nreally dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her\nselfishness.”\n\nThen another drop fell.\n\n“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he said; “I\nmust look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.\n\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up,\nand saw—Ah! what did he see?\n\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were\nrunning down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the\nmoonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\n\n“Who are you?” he said.\n\n“I am the Happy Prince.”\n\n“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched\nme.”\n\n“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not\nknow what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where\nsorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my\ncompanions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great\nHall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask\nwhat lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers\ncalled me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be\nhappiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have\nset me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery\nof my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but\nweep.”\n\n“What! is he not solid gold?” said the Swallow to himself.  He was too\npolite to make any personal remarks out loud.\n\n“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a\nlittle street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and\nthrough it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and\nworn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she\nis a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for\nthe loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next\nCourt-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying\nill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing\nto give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little\nSwallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet\nare fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow.  “My friends are flying up\nand down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they\nwill go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there\nhimself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and\nembalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and\nhis hands are like withered leaves.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and\nthe mother so sad.”\n\n“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow.  “Last summer, when I\nwas staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons,\nwho were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we\nswallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family\nfamous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.”\n\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.\n“It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one night,\nand be your messenger.”\n\n“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.\n\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and\nflew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\n\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were\nsculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A\nbeautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  “How wonderful\nthe stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the power of love!”\n\n“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she answered;\n“I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the\nseamstresses are so lazy.”\n\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of\nthe ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining\nwith each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he\ncame to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on\nhis bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he\nhopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble.\nThen he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his\nwings.  “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and\nhe sank into a delicious slumber.\n\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had\ndone.  “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although\nit is so cold.”\n\n“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince.  And the\nlittle Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always\nmade him sleepy.\n\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  “What a\nremarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was\npassing over the bridge.  “A swallow in winter!”  And he wrote a long\nletter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full\nof so many words that they could not understand.\n\n“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at\nthe prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time\non top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped,\nand said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so he enjoyed\nhimself very much.\n\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  “Have you any\ncommissions for Egypt?” he cried; “I am just starting.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow.  “To-morrow my friends\nwill fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among\nthe bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All\nnight long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he\nutters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions\ncome down to the water’s edge to drink.  They have eyes like green\nberyls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the\ncity I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered\nwith papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered\nviolets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a\npomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a\nplay for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any\nmore.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.”\n\n“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really had\na good heart.  “Shall I take him another ruby?”\n\n“Alas!  I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I\nhave left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of\nIndia a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.\nHe will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish\nhis play.”\n\n“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to\nweep.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the\nstudent’s garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in\nthe roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man\nhad his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the\nbird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying\non the withered violets.\n\n“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some great\nadmirer.  Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.\n\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of\na large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold\nwith ropes.  “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up.  “I am\ngoing to Egypt”! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon\nrose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n\n“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be\nhere.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the\ncrocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are\nbuilding a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves\nare watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave\nyou, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back\ntwo beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby\nshall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the\ngreat sea.”\n\n“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little\nmatch-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all\nspoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money,\nand she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is\nbare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will\nnot beat her.”\n\n“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot\npluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it.  He\nswooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her\nhand.  “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran\nhome, laughing.\n\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince.  “You are blind now,” he said,\n“so I will stay with you always.”\n\n“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt.”\n\n“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the\nPrince’s feet.\n\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of\nwhat he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who\nstand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their\nbeaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the\ndesert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the\nside of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King\nof the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a\nlarge crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and\nhas twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who\nsail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the\nbutterflies.\n\n“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous\nthings, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of\nwomen.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little\nSwallow, and tell me what you see there.”\n\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in\ntheir beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He\nflew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children\nlooking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a\nbridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep\nthemselves warm.  “How hungry we are!” they said.  “You must not lie\nhere,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\n\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\n\n“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off,\nleaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold\ncan make them happy.”\n\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy\nPrince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he\nbrought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier, and they\nlaughed and played games in the street.  “We have bread now!” they cried.\n\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets\nlooked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and\nglistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of\nthe houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore\nscarlet caps and skated on the ice.\n\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave\nthe Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the\nbaker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself\nwarm by flapping his wings.\n\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to\nfly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more.  “Good-bye, dear Prince!” he\nmurmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?”\n\n“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the\nPrince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips,\nfor I love you.”\n\n“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow.  “I am going to\nthe House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?”\n\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his\nfeet.\n\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something\nhad broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.\nIt certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\n\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in\ncompany with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked\nup at the statue: “Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!” he said.\n\n“How shabby indeed!” cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with\nthe Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\n\n“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is\ngolden no longer,” said the Mayor in fact, “he is litttle better than a\nbeggar!”\n\n“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors.\n\n“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!” continued the Mayor.  “We\nmust really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die\nhere.”  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\n\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  “As he is no longer\nbeautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the\nUniversity.\n\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of\nthe Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  “We must\nhave another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a statue of\nmyself.”\n\n“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.\nWhen I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.\n\n“What a strange thing!” said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.\n“This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it\naway.”  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also\nlying.\n\n“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to one of\nHis Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\n\n“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of Paradise this\nlittle bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy\nPrince shall praise me.”\n\n","Article 2001: The Free Trade Commission\n1.

A large carrier's van\nstands in the quadrangular fore-court of the White Hart Inn, upon the\nsides of its spacious tilt being painted, in weather-beaten letters:\n'Burthen, Carrier to Longpuddle.'  These vans, so numerous hereabout, are\na respectable, if somewhat lumbering, class of conveyance, much resorted\nto by decent travellers not overstocked with money, the better among them\nroughly corresponding to the old French _diligences_.\n\nThe present one is timed to leave the town at four in the afternoon\nprecisely, and it is now half-past three by the clock in the turret at\nthe top of the street.  In a few seconds errand-boys from the shops begin\nto arrive with packages, which they fling into the vehicle, and turn away\nwhistling, and care for the packages no more.  At twenty minutes to four\nan elderly woman places her basket upon the shafts, slowly mounts, takes\nup a seat inside, and folds her hands and her lips.  She has secured her\ncorner for the journey, though there is as yet no sign of a horse being\nput in, nor of a carrier.  At the three-quarters, two other women arrive,\nin whom the first recognizes the postmistress of Upper Longpuddle and the\nregistrar's wife, they recognizing her as the aged groceress of the same\nvillage.  At five minutes to the hour there approach Mr. Profitt, the\nschoolmaster, in a soft felt hat, and Christopher Twink, the\nmaster-thatcher; and as the hour strikes there rapidly drop in the parish\nclerk and his wife, the seedsman and his aged father, the registrar; also\nMr. Day, the world-ignored local landscape-painter, an elderly man who\nresides in his native place, and has never sold a picture outside it,\nthough his pretensions to art have been nobly supported by his fellow-\nvillagers, whose confidence in his genius has been as remarkable as the\nouter neglect of it, leading them to buy his paintings so extensively (at\nthe price of a few shillings each, it is true) that every dwelling in the\nparish exhibits three or four of those admired productions on its walls.\n\nBurthen, the carrier, is by this time seen bustling round the vehicle;\nthe horses are put in, the proprietor arranges the reins and springs up\ninto his seat as if he were used to it--which he is.\n\n'Is everybody here?' he asks preparatorily over his shoulder to the\npassengers within.\n\nAs those who were not there did not reply in the negative the muster was\nassumed to be complete, and after a few hitches and hindrances the van\nwith its human freight was got under way.  It jogged on at an easy pace\ntill it reached the bridge which formed the last outpost of the town.  The\ncarrier pulled up suddenly.\n\n'Bless my soul!' he said, 'I've forgot the curate!'\n\nAll who could do so gazed from the little back window of the van, but the\ncurate was not in sight.\n\n'Now I wonder where that there man is?' continued the carrier.\n\n'Poor man, he ought to have a living at his time of life.'\n\n'And he ought to be punctual,' said the carrier.  '\"Four o'clock sharp is\nmy time for starting,\" I said to 'en.  And he said, \"I'll be there.\"  Now\nhe's not here, and as a serious old church-minister he ought to be as\ngood as his word.  Perhaps Mr. Flaxton knows, being in the same line of\nlife?'  He turned to the parish clerk.\n\n'I was talking an immense deal with him, that's true, half an hour ago,'\nreplied that ecclesiastic, as one of whom it was no erroneous supposition\nthat he should be on intimate terms with another of the cloth.  'But he\ndidn't say he would be late.'\n\nThe discussion was cut off by the appearance round the corner of the van\nof rays from the curate's spectacles, followed hastily by his face and a\nfew white whiskers, and the swinging tails of his long gaunt coat.  Nobody\nreproached him, seeing how he was reproaching himself; and he entered\nbreathlessly and took his seat.\n\n'Now be we all here?' said the carrier again.  They started a second\ntime, and moved on till they were about three hundred yards out of the\ntown, and had nearly reached the second bridge, behind which, as every\nnative remembers, the road takes a turn and travellers by this highway\ndisappear finally from the view of gazing burghers.\n\n'Well, as I'm alive!' cried the postmistress from the interior of the\nconveyance, peering through the little square back-window along the road\ntownward.\n\n'What?' said the carrier.\n\n'A man hailing us!'\n\nAnother sudden stoppage.  'Somebody else?' the carrier asked.\n\n'Ay, sure!'  All waited silently, while those who could gaze out did so.\n\n'Now, who can that be?' Burthen continued.  'I just put it to ye,\nneighbours, can any man keep time with such hindrances?  Bain't we full\na'ready?  Who in the world can the man be?'\n\n'He's a sort of gentleman,' said the schoolmaster, his position\ncommanding the road more comfortably than that of his comrades.\n\nThe stranger, who had been holding up his umbrella to attract their\nnotice, was walking forward leisurely enough, now that he found, by their\nstopping, that it had been secured.  His clothes were decidedly not of a\nlocal cut, though it was difficult to point out any particular mark of\ndifference.  In his left hand he carried a small leather travelling bag.\nAs soon as he had overtaken the van he glanced at the inscription on its\nside, as if to assure himself that he had hailed the right conveyance,\nand asked if they had room.\n\nThe carrier replied that though they were pretty well laden he supposed\nthey could carry one more, whereupon the stranger mounted, and took the\nseat cleared for him within.  And then the horses made another move, this\ntime for good, and swung along with their burden of fourteen souls all\ntold.\n\n'You bain't one of these parts, sir?' said the carrier.  'I could tell\nthat as far as I could see 'ee.'\n\n'Yes, I am one of these parts,' said the stranger.\n\n'Oh?  H'm.'\n\nThe silence which followed seemed to imply a doubt of the truth of the\nnew-comer's assertion.  'I was speaking of Upper Longpuddle more\nparticular,' continued the carrier hardily, 'and I think I know most\nfaces of that valley.'\n\n'I was born at Longpuddle, and nursed at Longpuddle, and my father and\ngrandfather before me,' said the passenger quietly.\n\n'Why, to be sure,' said the aged groceress in the background, 'it isn't\nJohn Lackland's son--never--it can't be--he who went to foreign parts\nfive-and-thirty years ago with his wife and family?  Yet--what do I\nhear?--that's his father's voice!'\n\n'That's the man,' replied the stranger.  'John Lackland was my father,\nand I am John Lackland's son.  Five-and-thirty years ago, when I was a\nboy of eleven, my parents emigrated across the seas, taking me and my\nsister with them.  Kytes's boy Tony was the one who drove us and our\nbelongings to Casterbridge on the morning we left; and his was the last\nLongpuddle face I saw.  We sailed the same week across the ocean, and\nthere we've been ever since, and there I've left those I went with--all\nthree.'\n\n'Alive or dead?'\n\n'Dead,' he replied in a low voice.  'And I have come back to the old\nplace, having nourished a thought--not a definite intention, but just a\nthought--that I should like to return here in a year or two, to spend the\nremainder of my days.'\n\n'Married man, Mr. Lackland?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'And have the world used 'ee well, sir--or rather John, knowing 'ee as a\nchild?  In these rich new countries that we hear of so much, you've got\nrich with the rest?'\n\n'I am not very rich,' Mr. Lackland said.  'Even in new countries, you\nknow, there are failures.  The race is not always to the swift, nor the\nbattle to the strong; and even if it sometimes is, you may be neither\nswift nor strong.  However, that's enough about me.  Now, having answered\nyour inquiries, you must answer mine; for being in London, I have come\ndown here entirely to discover what Longpuddle is looking like, and who\nare living there.  That was why I preferred a seat in your van to hiring\na carriage for driving across.'\n\n'Well, as for Longpuddle, we rub on there much as usual.  Old figures\nhave dropped out o' their frames, so to speak it, and new ones have been\nput in their places.  You mentioned Tony Kytes as having been the one to\ndrive your family and your goods to Casterbridge in his father's waggon\nwhen you left.  Tony is, I believe, living still, but not at Longpuddle.\nHe went away and settled at Lewgate, near Mellstock, after his marriage.\nAh, Tony was a sort o' man!'\n\n'His character had hardly come out when I knew him.'\n\n'No.  But 'twas well enough, as far as that goes--except as to women.  I\nshall never forget his courting--never!'\n\nThe returned villager waited silently, and the carrier went on:--\n\n","\nWhen me and my friend drove down to meet some friends at a local college, we were not expecting to do any tripping. We had done plenty of weed and X, but neither of us had ever had the connection or the interest to get acid. When we discovered our friends had some acid left over from the night before, (it was a pretty big priority for us to have the LSD tested by a reliable source) we pitched in some money and purchased 8 hits, which were dropped on gummi peaches. We weren't spending the night, and drove home to make the midnight curfew my mom had imposed on us.\n\nWhen we were about 30 minutes from home, we decided to go ahead and each take 2 of our 4 hits, even though we knew we would have to be talking to my mom. Then we hit traffic on the interstate, even though it was 11:00 PM, and I started to get a little uneasy. About 10 minutes from home, and 40 minutes after we first dropped the hits, we both started to giggle. Driving became extremely fun for my friend, who informed me that he would not be able to stop laughing when my mom answered the door.\n\n1 hour after dropping:\nWe stifled laughter as we pushed past my mom into the basement, where we would be spending the night. I quickly ran downstairs and turned on the TV, anxious for my mom to go to bed. I soon realized my friend wasn't behind me. Tracing my steps backwards, I found him sitting in the stairway staring at a mural of some birds.\n'Are you seeing this?' he asked me.\nLooking at the mural to see what he was talking about, I saw the trees begin to sway and the birds take flight. Knowing we were going to be in for a long night, I pulled him down to the couch where we waited for my mom to go to bed.\n\n2 hours after dropping:\nThe state of mind I found myself in was extremely interesting. My friend was repeatedly trying to get me to call another friend to act as 'ground control,' for he explained to me that he would periodically lose all concept of who he was or the situation he was in. I was comfortable with my surroundings, and as I described it to him 'in my element.' I found myself in the bathroom staring in the mirror, my friend was standing beside me but had changed into a completely different person. Staring at his face for a period of about a minute would find him changing into 4 different people, an elf, and a dog. (I find myself still, several months later, able to change his face with some concentration when I am really high)\n\nThe one thing that I cannot stress enough about LSD induced hallucinations is how real they seem. I have seen things with weed before, but never with the detail and clarity which I experienced on acid. The people I saw my friend change into I had never seen before, but each one of them held very distinct features and detail in the face, and when he spoke the words would be spoken by whatever person I was currently seeing. It was truly amazing to me. I then turned to the mirror, and immediately saw my face melt and distort itself into hideous images. Reading through several trip accounts before attempting LSD, I found it fascinating the relative ease and comfort which people viewed these terrifying images they described. Experiencing this first hand, I felt a strange sense of safety while seeing this, knowing that I was on acid and this was all part of the experience. Having said this, I can easily see how bad trips develop and cannot stress the importance of knowing what you are getting into and being in a comfortable environment. (ie. your basement)\n\nAs I continued to look into the mirror I became unable to distinguish which side of the mirror I was on, and felt as though I was inside looking out. As I placed my head against the mirror and stared into my own eyes, I would shift in and out of the correct side of the mirror, momentarily losing grip on reality.\n\n3.5 hours after dropping:\nThe decision to go outside was made out of sheer wonder and curiosity. Seeming to have the opposite effect of weed, the acid seemed to OVER calm our fears so that we were not neccesarily as careful as we probably should have been. Nevertheless, after a very interesting walk we ended up in the middle of my cul-de-sac. Light was everywhere. The whole cul-de-sac was illuminated in red, blue, and white light. We continually thought we saw headlights, but instead of running or hiding we stared awestruck. As my friend described how the cement had transformed itself into a Roman tiling, I witnessed a very different scene. The cul-de-sac had appeared to be the scene of an earthquake, the ground had wide cracks and the car parked in front of my house seemed to be sinking into the ground. Reality was not a concern of mine, and we did not contemplate at the time how strange we must of looked standing in the middle of the cul-de-sac staring at things. We remained outside for a couple of hours, as thoughts and emotions raced through our head only to be gone and forgotten a couple of seconds later.\n\nAfter we had our fill, we began to walk back to the basement. The walk back was probably the only part of the trip that bordered on frightening, because with each step the door seemed to get farther away and once we arrived the entrance to the basement seemed very ominous.\n\n6.5 hours after dropping:\nWe sat down and watched a little TV, and had a great time laughing at the visions we shared of people protruding from the television set. About 7.5 or 8 hours since we began, we could feel reality coming back to us. I first began to sense it in that I began to smell and taste the real world. It is difficult to describe, but just the taste of my mouth and the normal smells of my house were things that had become lost during the trip, and were now beginning to ground me. I went upstairs fearing the sleeplessness (I had to work the next morning), but found myself able to sleep within 30 minutes) The next day at work found me 'not quite there,' but everything did seem a little brighter.\n\nLSD did not provide the euphoria that MDMA does, so if you are looking to FEEL amazing it may not be for you. However, it does make for a great 8 hour adventure. \n\n","Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom.\nWell who am I to keep you down it's only right that you should play the way you feel it.\nBut listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness.\nLike a heartbeat drives you mad in the stillness of remembering what you had,\nand what you lost, and what you had, and what you lost.\n\nThunder only happens when it's raining.\nPlayers only love you when they're playing.\nSay women they will come and they will go.\nWhen the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know.\n\nNow here I go again, I see the crystal visions.\nI keep my visions to myself, it's only me.\nWho wants to wrap around your dreams and have you any dreams you'd like to sell?\nDreams of loneliness, like a heartbeat, drives you mad in the stillness of remembering, what you had.\nAnd what you lost and what you had and what you lost.\n\n","Article 901: Scope and Coverage\n1. This Chapter applies to standards-related measures of a Party, other than those covered by Section B of Chapter Seven (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade in goods or services between the Parties, and to measures of the Parties relating to such measures.\n2. Technical specifications prepared by governmental bodies for production or consumption requirements of such bodies shall be governed exclusively by Chapter Ten (Government Procurement).\nArticle 902: Extent of Obligations\n1. Article 105 (Extent of Obligations) does not apply to this Chapter.\n2. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure observance of Articles 904 through 908 by state or provincial governments and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory.\nArticle 903: Affirmation of Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and Other Agreements\nFurther to Article 103 (Relation to Other Agreements), the Parties affirm with respect to each other their existing rights and obligations relating to standards-related measures under the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and all other international agreements, including environmental and conservation agreements, to which those Parties are party.\nArticle 904: Basic Rights and Obligations\nRight to Take Standards-Related Measures\n1. Each Party may, in accordance with this Agreement, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure, including any such measure relating to safety, the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, and any measure to ensure its enforcement or implementation. Such measures include those to prohibit the importation of a good of another Party or the provision of a service by a service provider of another Party that fails to comply with the applicable requirements of those measures or to complete the Party's approval procedures.\nRight to Establish Level of Protection\n2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, each Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives of safety or the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, establish the levels of protection that it considers appropriate in accordance with Article 907(2).\nNon-Discriminatory Treatment\n3. Each Party shall, in respect of its standards-related measures, accord to goods and service providers of another Party:\n\n(a) national treatment in accordance with Article 301 (Market Access) or Article 1202 (Cross-Border Trade in Services); and\n(b) treatment no less favorable than that it accords to like goods, or in like circumstances to service providers, of any other country.\nUnnecessary Obstacles\n4. No Party may prepare, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure with a view to or with the effect of creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties. An unnecessary obstacle to trade shall not be deemed to be created where:\n\n(a) the demonstrable purpose of the measure is to achieve a legitimate objective; and\n(b) the measure does not operate to exclude goods of another Party that meet that legitimate objective.\nArticle 905: Use of International Standards\n1. Each Party shall use, as a basis for its standards-related measures, relevant international standards or international standards whose completion is imminent, except where such standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means to fulfill its legitimate objectives, for example because of fundamental climatic, geographical, technological or infrastructural factors, scientific justification or the level of protection that the Party considers appropriate.\n2. A Party's standards-related measure that conforms to an international standard shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 904(3) and (4).\n3. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, from adopting, maintaining or applying any standards-related measure that results in a higher level of protection than would be achieved if the measure were based on the relevant international standard.\nArticle 906: Compatibility and Equivalence\n1. Recognizing the crucial role of standards-related measures in achieving legitimate objectives, the Parties shall, in accordance with this Chapter, work jointly to enhance the level of safety and of protection of human, animal and plant life and health, the environment and consumers.\n2. Without reducing the level of safety or of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, without prejudice to the rights of any Party under this Chapter, and taking into account international standardization activities, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable, make compatible their respective standards-related measures, so as to facilitate trade in a good or service between the Parties.\n3. Further to Articles 902 and 905, a Party shall, on request of another Party, seek, through appropriate measures, to promote the compatibility of a specific standard or conformity assessment procedure that is maintained in its territory with the standards or conformity assessment procedures maintained in the territory of the other Party.\n4. Each importing Party shall treat a technical regulation adopted or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with the importing Party, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the importing Party that its technical regulation adequately fulfills the importing Party's legitimate objectives.\n5. The importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party, on request, its reasons in writing for not treating a technical regulation as equivalent under paragraph 4.\n6. Each Party shall, wherever possible, accept the results of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of another Party, provided that it is satisfied that the procedure offers an assurance, equivalent to that provided by a procedure it conducts or a procedure conducted in its territory the results of which it accepts, that the relevant good or service complies with the applicable technical regulation or standard adopted or maintained in the Party's territory.\n7. Prior to accepting the results of a conformity assessment procedure pursuant to paragraph 6, and to enhance confidence in the continued reliability of each other's conformity assessment results, the Parties may consult on such matters as the technical competence of the conformity assessment bodies involved, including verified compliance with relevant international standards through such means as accreditation.\nArticle 907: Assessment of Risk\n1. A Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, conduct an assessment of risk. In conducting an assessment, a Party may take into account, among other factors relating to a good or service:\n\n(a) available scientific evidence or technical information;\n(b) intended end uses;\n(c) processes or production, operating, inspection, sampling or testing methods; or\n(d) environmental conditions.\n2. Where pursuant to Article 904(2) a Party establishes a level of protection that it considers appropriate and conducts an assessment of risk, it should avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions between similar goods or services in the level of protection it considers appropriate, where the distinctions:\n\n(a) result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against goods or service providers of another Party;\n(b) constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties; or\n(c) discriminate between similar goods or services for the same use under the same conditions that pose the same level of risk and provide similar benefits.\n3. Where a Party conducting an assessment of risk determines that available scientific evidence or other information is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a provisional technical regulation on the basis of available relevant information. The Party shall, within a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the assessment of risk is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and, where appropriate, revise the provisional technical regulation in the light of that assessment.\nArticle 908: Conformity Assessment\n1. The Parties shall, further to Article 906 and recognizing the existence of substantial differences in the structure, organization and operation of conformity assessment procedures in their respective territories, make compatible those procedures to the greatest extent practicable.\n2. Recognizing that it should be to the mutual advantage of the Parties concerned and except as set out in Annex 908.2, each Party shall accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies in the territory of another Party on terms no less favorable than those accorded to conformity assessment bodies in its territory.\n3. Each Party shall, with respect to its conformity assessment procedures:\n\n(a) not adopt or maintain any such procedure that is stricter, nor apply the procedure more strictly, than necessary to give it confidence that a good or a service conforms with an applicable technical regulation or standard, taking into account the risks that non-conformity would create;\n(b) initiate and complete the procedure as expeditiously as possible;\n(c) in accordance with Article 904(3), undertake processing of applications in non-discriminatory order;\n(d) publish the normal processing period for each such procedure or communicate the anticipated processing period to an applicant on request;\n(e) ensure that the competent body\n\n(i) on receipt of an application, promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of any deficiency,\n(ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible the results of the conformity assessment procedure in a form that is precise and complete so that the applicant may take any necessary corrective action,\n(iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds as far as practicable with the procedure where the applicant so requests, and\n(iv) informs the applicant, on request, of the status of the application and the reasons for any delay;\n(f) limit the information the applicant is required to supply to that necessary to conduct the procedure and to determine appropriate fees;\n(g) accord confidential or proprietary information arising from, or supplied in connection with, the conduct of the procedure for a good of another Party or for a service provided by a person of another Party\n\n(i) the same treatment as that for a good of the Party or a service provided by a person of the Party, and\n(ii) in any event, treatment that protects an applicant's legitimate commercial interests to the extent provided under the Party's law;\n(h) ensure that any fee it imposes for conducting the procedure is no higher for a good of another Party or a service provider of another Party than is equitable in relation to any such fee imposed for its like goods or service providers or for like goods or service providers of any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and other related costs;\n(i) ensure that the location of facilities at which a conformity assessment procedure is conducted does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent;\n(j) limit the procedure, for a good or service modified subsequent to a determination that the good or service conforms to the applicable technical regulation or standard, to that necessary to determine that the good or service continues to conform to the technical regulation or standard; and\n(k) limit any requirement regarding samples of a good to that which is reasonable, and ensure that the selection of samples does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent.\n4. Each Party shall apply, with such modifications as may be necessary, the relevant provisions of paragraph 3 to its approval procedures.\n5. Each Party shall, on request of another Party, take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate access in its territory for conformity assessment activities.\n6. Each Party shall give sympathetic consideration to a request by another Party to negotiate agreements for the mutual recognition of the results of that other Party's conformity assessment procedures.\nArticle 909: Notification, Publication, and Provision of Information\n1. Further to Articles 1802 (Publication) and 1803 (Notification and Provision of Information), each Party proposing to adopt or modify a technical regulation shall:\n\n(a) at least 60 days prior to the adoption or modification of the measure, other than a law, publish a notice and notify in writing the other Parties of the proposed measure in such a manner as to enable interested persons to become acquainted with the proposed measure, except that in the case of any such measure relating to perishable goods, each Party shall, to the greatest extent practicable, publish the notice and provide the notification at least 30 days prior to the adoption or modification of the measure, but no later than when notification is provided to domestic producers;\n(b) identify in the notice and notification the good or service to which the measure would apply, and shall provide a brief description of the objective of, and reasons for the measure;\n(c) provide a copy of the proposed measure to any Party or interested person that so requests, and shall, wherever possible, identify any provision that deviates in substance from relevant international standards; and\n(d) without discrimination, allow other Parties and interested persons to make comments in writing and shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account.\n2. Each Party proposing to adopt or modify a standard or any conformity assessment procedure not otherwise considered to be a technical regulation shall, where an international standard relevant to the proposed measure does not exist or such measure is not substantially the same as an international standard, and where the measure may have a significant effect on the trade of the other Parties:\n\n(a) at an early appropriate stage, publish a notice and provide a notification of the type required in paragraph 1(a) and (b); and\n(b) observe paragraph (c) and (d).\n3. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure, with respect to a technical regulation of a state or provincial government other than a local government:\n\n(a) that, at an early appropriate stage, a notice and notification of the type required under paragraph 1(a) and (b) are made prior to their adoption; and\n(b) observance of paragraph (c) and (d).\n4. Where a Party considers it necessary to address an urgent problem relating to safety or to protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, it may omit any step set out in paragraph 1 or 3, provided that on adoption of a standards-related measure it shall:\n\n(a) immediately provide to the other Parties a notification of the type required under paragraph 1(b), including a brief description of the urgent problem;\n(b) provide a copy of the measure to any Party or interested person that so requests; and\n(c) without discrimination, allow other Parties and interested persons to make comments in writing, and shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account.\n5. Each Party shall, except where necessary to address an urgent problem referred to in paragraph 4, allow a reasonable period between the publication of a standards-related measure and the date that it becomes effective to allow time for interested persons to adapt to the measure.\n6. Where a Party allows non-governmental persons in its territory to be present during the process of development of standards-related measures, it shall also allow non-governmental persons from the territories of the other Parties to be present.\n7. Each Party shall notify the other Parties of the development of, amendment to, or change in the application of its standards-related measures no later than the time at which it notifies non-governmental persons in general or the relevant sector in its territory.\n8. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure the observance of paragraphs 6 and 7 by a state or provincial government, and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory.\n9. Each Party shall designate by January 1, 1994 a government authority responsible for the implementation at the federal level of the notification provisions of this Article, and shall notify the other Parties thereof. Where a Party designates two or more government authorities for that purpose, it shall provide to the other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope of responsibility of each such authority.\nArticle 910: Inquiry Points\n1. Each Party shall ensure that there is an inquiry point that is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from other Parties and interested persons, and to provide relevant documents regarding:\n\n(a) any standards-related measure proposed, adopted or maintained in its territory at the federal, state or provincial government level;\n(b) the membership and participation of the Party, or its relevant federal, state or provincial government authorities, in international and regional standardizing bodies and conformity assessment systems, and in bilateral and multilateral arrangements regarding standards-related measures, and the provisions of those systems and arrangements;\n(c) the location of notices published pursuant to Article 909, or where the information can be obtained;\n(d) the location of the inquiry points referred to in paragraph 3; and\n(e) the Party's procedures for assessment of risk, and factors it considers in conducting the assessment and in establishing, pursuant to Article 904(2), the levels of protection that it considers appropriate.\n2. Where a Party designates more than one inquiry point, it shall:\n\n(a) provide to the other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope of responsibility of each inquiry point; and\n(b) ensure that any inquiry addressed to an incorrect inquiry point is promptly conveyed to the correct inquiry point.\n3. Each Party shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure that there is at least one inquiry point that is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from other Parties and interested persons and to provide relevant documents or information as to where they can be obtained regarding:\n\n(a) any standard or conformity assessment procedure proposed, adopted or maintained by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory; and\n(b) the membership and participation of relevant non-governmental bodies in its territory in international and regional standardizing bodies and conformity assessment systems.\n4.

About the second day out of school, I discovered some LSD at 9 AM in the morning. Whether I had eaten breakfast or not I don't remember, but i would guess NO. I was shocked looking at the two little green gel tabs, I put them in my mouth without hesitation and felt them disolve. OH WOW i thought before any of the effects kicked in, I just ate something that's going to make me trip for hours and hours seeing everything I've ever wanted to!\n\nHere I will give my previous drug experience:\nI had smoked endless amounts of pot just about every day starting about mid-junior year. I had eaten ecstacy about 5 times and I always felt uncomfortable getting an unnatural ecstatic emotion, and ecstacy is just bad for you, I say, and so does the evidence showing severe brain damage. Also at that point I had had one fun yet mild mushroom experience.\n\nI sat down at the computer to play an online game. I played about 15 minutes until the anticipation really kicked in. I started getting shaky and VERY ANXIOUS. I turned around and saw fishing poles in the corner of the room, they were taller than ever before and they towered over everything! At this point I figured I should go check things out, it's coming on. I got down on the floor and looked at my imitation oriental rug to see what was seen in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the pattern rose off the carpet, my eyes were really starting to play tricks on me.\n\nI need a shower. I get in the bathroom and the towels are breathing and pulsating, my vision was wacky. I could see small areas blown up very big and nothing other than my immediate vision. At this point I'm lost in my visuals and I'm in the shower feeling fucking great. I see a drop of water on the shower curtain and think, 'what would life be like inside a drop of water?'\n\nI'm out of the shower and decide to play my bass guitar. I put on Rage against the Machine's - Battle of LA. I am really feeling the music AND the the LSD...what a suprise! I'm softly inserting undertones on my bass, and I see the neck and strings all waving, up close, big, out of proportion, completely and utterly awesome! The anxiety is still there, STRONG, I'm trying to enjoy myself but the LSD is so freakin powerful!!!\n\nI start hearing audio hallucinations and at the same time visuals of lights turning on and off, plenty of color. The audio hallucinations sounded like the devil. Voices outside sounded like rumbling thunder. At this point I really need to talk to someone. I call my Mom at work. As soon as I start speaking I sound very loud and unusual, my Mom asks if I'm alright...what am I supposed to say, 'Well I'm on LSD!' No, that's not right.\n\nNow I REALLY need to leave my house or else the anxiety will drive me into a wall! I go outside with the phone and a cigarette. The side of my house looked like it was expanding in the upwards and downwards directions. I get in touch with my friend, who I'll call N, and I go to his house down the street to meet him and another friend A, whom were and are two of my best friends.\n\nWhen I get there I'm talking very loud and I say I think I've eaten some LSD. After a while, it is abundantly clear to them that I have. They stick by me and keep me relaxed. We drive over to a friend's house I'll call E, another best, and he has a friend chillin there. I wasn't feeling too high at this point, but everything on my mind was affecting me.\n\nI call my Mom again to talk, I tell her what happened, and she wants me home immediately. This was something I had to struggle with, I didn't wanna go home I'm out enjoying a high what good would coming home be if i'm going to get in trouble??? I decided to stay out and told my parents I would be safe and home later that evening.\n\nI go have a quality conversation with my friend A. He is a very experienced tripper of LSD and he comforts while we talk about jokes or funny experiences while the other people are out somewhere. They get back and I go for a ride with my friend N, we talk and I tell him how horrible the situation I'm in is, and that I'm in trouble. He ensures me that he is there and will help me.\n\nWe get back to E's house and then another friend shows up, he wants to smoke. Five of us head down the street to another friend's house to smoke. We sit out back and smoke dank bud out of a bubbler. My high starts to come back a little but the plateau had worn off a while ago.\n\nMy thinking goes on auto-pilot. I would think about the ramifications and harmony that come about through conversation. I decided not to speak after my thoughts flew right past the conversation.\n\nI come around after taking a piss and declare that on this day I am fucked up! At this point I feel sober enough to talk. I start to relax and my anxiety goes away. The trip slowed down and I started coming back to baseline.\n\nI decide it would be good to go home around 5 PM. When I go home I see some more visuals, talk with my parents, and make ammends. Almost a year has passed now. Since that summer, in the way of drugs I've decided not to touch cocaine, not to take LSD, ecstacy, heroine, ect...be careful, especially of the big ones...i'm serious\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this and learned a few things...\n\n\nRetrospective:\nFrom my personal experience...\n\nEating LSD at 9 AM: expect a freaking trip (see above) ^^.\nGel Tabs are potent, handle with care. I ate some 2 hits of paper/blotter about 2 months later and it wasn't a quarter as strong.\n\nHave friends & people you love to be with. \n\n","Haha yeah.","ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.  He had\nbright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long\nbit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the\npond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who\nwas pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand\non their heads in the water.\n\n“You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your\nheads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them\nhow it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They\nwere so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in\nsociety at all.\n\n“What disobedient children!” cried the old Water-rat; “they really\ndeserve to be drowned.”\n\n“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a\nbeginning, and parents cannot be too patient.”\n\n“Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the Water-rat;\n“I am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never\nintend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much\nhigher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or\nrarer than a devoted friendship.”\n\n“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?” asked a\nGreen Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard\nthe conversation.\n\n“Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam away\nto the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her\nchildren a good example.\n\n“What a silly question!” cried the Water-rat.  “I should expect my\ndevoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.”\n\n“And what would you do in return?” said the little bird, swinging upon a\nsilver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.\n\n“I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat.\n\n“Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Is the story about me?” asked the Water-rat.  “If so, I will listen to\nit, for I am extremely fond of fiction.”\n\n“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and\nalighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.\n\n“Once upon a time,” said the Linnet, “there was an honest little fellow\nnamed Hans.”\n\n“Was he very distinguished?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“No,” answered the Linnet, “I don’t think he was distinguished at all,\nexcept for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He\nlived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his\ngarden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.\nSweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds’-purses, and\nFair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac\nCrocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock,\nMarjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil\nand the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the\nmonths went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there\nwere always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.\n\n“Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all\nwas big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to\nlittle Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over\nthe wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or\nfilling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.\n\n“‘Real friends should have everything in common,’ the Miller used to say,\nand little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend\nwith such noble ideas.\n\n“Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich\nMiller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred\nsacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large\nflock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these\nthings, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the\nwonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true\nfriendship.\n\n“So little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the\nsummer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and\nhe had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good\ndeal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper\nbut a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was\nextremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.\n\n“‘There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow\nlasts,’ the Miller used to say to his wife, ‘for when people are in\ntrouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That\nat least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I\nshall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and\nhe will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make\nhim so happy.’\n\n“‘You are certainly very thoughtful about others,’ answered the Wife, as\nshe sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ‘very\nthoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about\nfriendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful\nthings as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear\na gold ring on his little finger.’\n\n“‘But could we not ask little Hans up here?’ said the Miller’s youngest\nson.  ‘If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and\nshow him my white rabbits.’\n\n“‘What a silly boy you are!’ cried the Miller; ‘I really don’t know what\nis the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything.\nWhy, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good\nsupper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is\na most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature.  I certainly\nwill not allow Hans’ nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I\nwill always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any\ntemptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have\nsome flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and\nfriendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words\nare spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can\nsee that.’\n\n“‘How well you talk!’ said the Miller’s Wife, pouring herself out a large\nglass of warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in\nchurch.’\n\n“‘Lots of people act well,’ answered the Miller; ‘but very few people\ntalk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of\nthe two, and much the finer thing also’; and he looked sternly across the\ntable at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his\nhead down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.\nHowever, he was so young that you must excuse him.”\n\n“Is that the end of the story?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Certainly not,” answered the Linnet, “that is the beginning.”\n\n“Then you are quite behind the age,” said the Water-rat.  “Every good\nstory-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the\nbeginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I\nheard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the\npond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am\nsure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head,\nand whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ‘Pooh!’\nBut pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all\nkinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy\nbetween us.”\n\n“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, “as\nsoon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale\nyellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see\nlittle Hans.\n\n“‘Why, what a good heart you have!’ cried his Wife; ‘you are always\nthinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the\nflowers.’\n\n“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron\nchain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.\n\n“‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to\near.\n\n“‘And how have you been all the winter?’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very good\nindeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring\nhas come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.’\n\n“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and\nwondered how you were getting on.’\n\n“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten\nme.’\n\n“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never\nforgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t\nunderstand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking,\nby-the-bye!”\n\n“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky\nthing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the\nmarket and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my\nwheelbarrow with the money.’\n\n“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don’t mean to say you have sold it?\nWhat a very stupid thing to do!’\n\n“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to.  You see the\nwinter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to\nbuy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,\nand then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last\nI sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.’\n\n“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in\nvery good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong\nwith the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I\nknow it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me\nextremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the\nworld.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,\nbesides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your\nmind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.’\n\n“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his funny\nround face glowed all over with pleasure.  ‘I can easily put it in\nrepair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.’\n\n“‘A plank of wood!’ said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want for\nthe roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will\nall get damp if I don’t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is\nquite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given\nyou my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of\ncourse, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,\nfriendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I\nwill set to work at my barn this very day.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the\nplank out.\n\n“‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I am\nafraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left for\nyou to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.\nAnd now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to\ngive me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it\nquite full.’\n\n“‘Quite full?’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a\nvery big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no\nflowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver\nbuttons back.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘as I have given you my\nwheelbarrow, I don’t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.\nI may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true\nfriendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.’\n\n“‘My dear friend, my best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you are welcome to\nall the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion\nthan my silver buttons, any day’; and he ran and plucked all his pretty\nprimroses, and filled the Miller’s basket.\n\n“‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said the Miller, as he went up the hill with\nthe plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.\n\n“‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he\nwas so pleased about the wheelbarrow.\n\n“The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when\nhe heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped\noff the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.\n\n“There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this sack\nof flour for me to market?’\n\n“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day.  I\nhave got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all\nmy grass to roll.’\n\n“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I am\ngoing to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to\nrefuse.’\n\n“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly for\nthe whole world’; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big\nsack on his shoulders.\n\n“It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans\nhad reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down\nand rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the\nmarket.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour\nfor a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was\nafraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.\n\n“‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as he\nwas going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is\nmy best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.’\n\n“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his\nsack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.\n\n“‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy.  Really,\nconsidering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might\nwork harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of\nmy friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite\nplainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not\nyour friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say\nexactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to\nplease and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,\nand does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he\nprefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off\nhis night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for\na little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I\nalways work better after hearing the birds sing?’\n\n“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the\nback, ‘for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed,\nand mend my barn-roof for me.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his\nflowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse\nthe Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.\n\n“‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?’ he\ninquired in a shy and timid voice.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to ask\nof you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of\ncourse if you refuse I will go and do it myself.’\n\n“‘Oh! on no account,’ cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and\ndressed himself, and went up to the barn.\n\n“He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came\nto see how he was getting on.\n\n“‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?’ cried the\nMiller in a cheery voice.\n\n“‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.\n\n“‘Ah!’ said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work one\ndoes for others.’\n\n“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered little\nHans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ‘a very great privilege.\nBut I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.’\n\n“‘Oh! they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take more\npains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you\nwill have the theory also.’\n\n“‘Do you really think I shall?’ asked little Hans.\n\n“‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered the Miller, ‘but now that you have\nmended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive\nmy sheep to the mountain to-morrow.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next\nmorning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans\nstarted off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get\nthere and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to\nsleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.\n\n“‘What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,’ he said, and he went\nto work at once.\n\n“But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his\nfriend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long\nerrands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much\ndistressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had\nforgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller\nwas his best friend.  ‘Besides,’ he used to say, ‘he is going to give me\nhis wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.’\n\n“So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds\nof beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a\nnote-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good\nscholar.\n\n“Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside\nwhen a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind\nwas blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he\nthought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a\nthird, louder than any of the others.\n\n“‘It is some poor traveller,’ said little Hans to himself, and he ran to\nthe door.\n\n“There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the\nother.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ cried the Miller, ‘I am in great trouble.  My little\nboy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the\nDoctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it\nhas just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead\nof me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is\nonly fair that you should do something for me in return.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take it quite as a compliment your\ncoming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your\nlantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the\nditch.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ answered the Miller, ‘but it is my new lantern, and\nit would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.’\n\n“‘Well, never mind, I will do without it,’ cried little Hans, and he took\ndown his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler\nround his throat, and started off.\n\n“What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans\ncould hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely\nstand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking\nabout three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the\ndoor.\n\n“‘Who is there?’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom\nwindow.\n\n“‘Little Hans, Doctor.’\n\n“’What do you want, little Hans?’\n\n“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and\nthe Miller wants you to come at once.’\n\n“‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big\nboots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the\ndirection of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him.\n\n“But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and\nlittle Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.\nAt last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very\ndangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans\nwas drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating\nin a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.\n\n“Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and the\nMiller was the chief mourner.\n\n“‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I\nshould have the best place’; so he walked at the head of the procession\nin a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a\nbig pocket-handkerchief.\n\n“‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the\nBlacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated\ncomfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.\n\n“‘A great loss to me at any rate,’ answered the Miller; ‘why, I had as\ngood as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don’t know what to do\nwith it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair\nthat I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take\ncare not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being\ngenerous.’”\n\n“Well?” said the Water-rat, after a long pause.\n\n“Well, that is the end,” said the Linnet.\n\n“But what became of the Miller?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Oh!  I really don’t know,” replied the Linnet; “and I am sure that I\ndon’t care.”\n\n“It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,” said\nthe Water-rat.\n\n“I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the\nLinnet.\n\n“The what?” screamed the Water-rat.\n\n“The moral.”\n\n“Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Well, really,” said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, “I think you\nshould have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I\ncertainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said\n‘Pooh,’ like the critic.  However, I can say it now”; so he shouted out\n“Pooh” at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back\ninto his hole.\n\n“And how do you like the Water-rat?” asked the Duck, who came paddling up\nsome minutes afterwards.  “He has a great many good points, but for my\nown part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed\nbachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.”\n\n“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet.  “The\nfact is, that I told him a story with a moral.”\n\n“Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,” said the Duck.\n\nAnd I quite agree with her.\n\n","IT was well said of a certain German book that “_er lasst sich nicht\nlesen_”--it does not permit itself to be read. There are some secrets\nwhich do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in their\nbeds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them\npiteously in the eyes--die with despair of heart and convulsion of\nthroat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer\nthemselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the conscience of man\ntakes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only\ninto the grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.\n\nNot long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the\nlarge bow window of the D----- Coffee-House in London. For some months\nI had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with returning\nstrength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so\nprecisely the converse of ennui--moods of the keenest appetency, when\nthe film from the mental vision departs--the [Greek phrase]--and the\nintellect, electrified, surpasses as greatly its every-day condition,\nas does the vivid yet candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy\nrhetoric of Gorgias. Merely to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived\npositive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain. I\nfelt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing. With a cigar in\nmy mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had been amusing myself for the\ngreater part of the afternoon, now in poring over advertisements, now\nin observing the promiscuous company in the room, and now in peering\nthrough the smoky panes into the street.\n\nThis latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had\nbeen very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came\non, the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well\nlighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past\nthe door. At this particular period of the evening I had never before\nbeen in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads\nfilled me, therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up,\nat length, all care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in\ncontemplation of the scene without.\n\nAt first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn.\nI looked at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their\naggregate relations. Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded\nwith minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air,\ngait, visage, and expression of countenance.\n\nBy far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied\nbusiness-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their\nway through the press. Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled\nquickly; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom\nof impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still\na numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces,\nand talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude\non account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in\ntheir progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled\ntheir gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile\nupon the lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled,\nthey bowed profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with\nconfusion.--There was nothing very distinctive about these two large\nclasses beyond what I have noted. Their habiliments belonged to that\norder which is pointedly termed the decent. They were undoubtedly\nnoblemen, merchants, attorneys, tradesmen, stock-jobbers--the Eupatrids\nand the common-places of society--men of leisure and men actively\nengaged in affairs of their own--conducting business upon their own\nresponsibility. They did not greatly excite my attention.\n\nThe tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned\ntwo remarkable divisions. There were the junior clerks of flash\nhouses--young gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair,\nand supercilious lips. Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage,\nwhich may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of\nthese persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the\nperfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. They wore\nthe cast-off graces of the gentry;--and this, I believe, involves the\nbest definition of the class.\n\nThe division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the “steady\nold fellows,” it was not possible to mistake. These were known by their\ncoats and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with\nwhite cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose\nor gaiters.--They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right\nears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on\nend. I observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both\nhands, and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and\nancient pattern. Theirs was the affectation of respectability;--if\nindeed there be an affectation so honorable.\n\nThere were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily\nunderstood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which\nall great cities are infested. I watched these gentry with much\ninquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever\nbe mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. Their voluminousness\nof wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at\nonce.\n\nThe gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily\nrecognisable. They wore every variety of dress, from that of the\ndesperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief,\ngilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate\nclergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still\nall were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a\nfilmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two\nother traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them;--a guarded\nlowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of\nthe thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers.--Very often,\nin company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat\ndifferent in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. They may be\ndefined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey\nupon the public in two battalions--that of the dandies and that of the\nmilitary men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and\nsmiles; of the second frogged coats and frowns.\n\nDescending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker\nand deeper themes for speculation. I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes\nflashing from countenances whose every other feature wore only an\nexpression of abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars\nscowling upon mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had\ndriven forth into the night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids,\nupon whom death had placed a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered\nthrough the mob, looking every one beseechingly in the face, as if in\nsearch of some chance consolation, some lost hope; modest young girls\nreturning from long and late labor to a cheerless home, and shrinking\nmore tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians, whose\ndirect contact, even, could not be avoided; women of the town of all\nkinds and of all ages--the unequivocal beauty in the prime of her\nwomanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in Lucian, with the surface\nof Parian marble, and the interior filled with filth--the loathsome and\nutterly lost leper in rags--the wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed\nbeldame, making a last effort at youth--the mere child of immature form,\nyet, from long association, an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her\ntrade, and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her\nelders in vice; drunkards innumerable and indescribable--some in shreds\nand patches, reeling, inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre\neyes--some in whole although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady\nswagger, thick sensual lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces--others\nclothed in materials which had once been good, and which even now were\nscrupulously well brushed--men who walked with a more than naturally\nfirm and springy step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose\neyes hideously wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as\nthey strode through the crowd, at every object which came within\ntheir reach; beside these, pie-men, porters, coal--heavers, sweeps;\norgan-grinders, monkey-exhibiters and ballad mongers, those who vended\nwith those who sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every\ndescription, and all full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which\njarred discordantly upon the ear, and gave an aching sensation to the\neye.\n\nAs the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for\nnot only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its\ngentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly\nportion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder\nrelief, as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its\nden,) but the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle\nwith the dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over\nevery thing a fitful and garish lustre. All was dark yet splendid--as\nthat ebony to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.\n\nThe wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of\nindividual faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of\nlight flitted before the window, prevented me from casting more than\na glance upon each visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar\nmental state, I could frequently read, even in that brief interval of a\nglance, the history of long years.\n\nWith my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob,\nwhen suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old\nman, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)--a countenance which\nat once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the\nabsolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. Any thing even remotely\nresembling that expression I had never seen before. I well remember that\nmy first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it,\nwould have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the\nfiend. As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey,\nto form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly\nand paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of\ncaution, of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of\nblood thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror,\nof intense--of supreme despair. I felt singularly aroused, startled,\nfascinated. “How wild a history,” I said to myself, “is written within\nthat bosom!” Then came a craving desire to keep the man in view--to know\nmore of him. Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and\ncane, I made my way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in\nthe direction which I had seen him take; for he had already disappeared.\nWith some little difficulty I at length came within sight of him,\napproached, and followed him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to\nattract his attention.\n\nI had now a good opportunity of examining his person. He was short in\nstature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally,\nwere filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong\nglare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of\nbeautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a\nclosely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped\nhim, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. These\nobservations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the\nstranger whithersoever he should go.\n\nIt was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city,\nsoon ending in a settled and heavy rain. This change of weather had an\nodd effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new\ncommotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the\njostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. For my own part I\ndid not much regard the rain--the lurking of an old fever in my system\nrendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a\nhandkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man\nheld his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here\nwalked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never\nonce turning his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and bye he\npassed into a cross street, which, although densely filled with people,\nwas not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a\nchange in his demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with\nless object than before--more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed\nthe way repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so\nthick that, at every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely.\nThe street was a narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for\nnearly an hour, during which the passengers had gradually diminished to\nabout that number which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the\nPark--so vast a difference is there between a London populace and that\nof the most frequented American city. A second turn brought us into a\nsquare, brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. The old manner\nof the stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his\neyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon\nthose who hemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I\nwas surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of\nthe square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I\nastonished to see him repeat the same walk several times--once nearly\ndetecting me as he came round with a sudden movement.\n\nIn this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with\nfar less interruption from passengers than at first. The rain fell fast;\nthe air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. With\na gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a bye-street\ncomparatively deserted. Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he\nrushed with an activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so\naged, and which put me to much trouble in pursuit. A few minutes brought\nus to a large and busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger\nappeared well acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became\napparent, as he forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host\nof buyers and sellers.\n\nDuring the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this\nplace, it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach\nwithout attracting his observation. Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc\nover-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence. At no moment did\nhe see that I watched him. He entered shop after shop, priced nothing,\nspoke no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare.\nI was now utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we\nshould not part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting\nhim.\n\nA loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting\nthe bazaar. A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old\nman, and at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. He\nhurried into the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and\nthen ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less\nlanes, until we emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we\nhad started--the street of the D---- Hotel. It no longer wore, however,\nthe same aspect. It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell\nfiercely, and there were few persons to be seen. The stranger grew pale.\nHe walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a\nheavy sigh, turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through\na great variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of\nthe principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were\nthronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while\nhe threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of\nhis countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon\nhis breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that\nhe now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the\naudience--but, upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the\nwaywardness of his actions.\n\nAs he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness\nand vacillation were resumed. For some time he followed closely a\nparty of some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one\ndropped off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy\nlane little frequented. The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed\nlost in thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly\na route which brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very\ndifferent from those we had hitherto traversed. It was the most noisome\nquarter of London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most\ndeplorable poverty, and of the most desperate crime. By the dim light\nof an accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were\nseen tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that\nscarce the semblance of a passage was discernible between them.\nThe paving-stones lay at random, displaced from their beds by the\nrankly-growing grass. Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters.\nThe whole atmosphere teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the\nsounds of human life revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands\nof the most abandoned of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro.\nThe spirits of the old man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near\nits death hour. Once more he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly\na corner was turned, a blaze of light burst upon our sight, and we stood\nbefore one of the huge suburban temples of Intemperance--one of the\npalaces of the fiend, Gin.\n\nIt was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still\npressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. With a half shriek of\njoy the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original\nbearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object,\namong the throng. He had not been thus long occupied, however, before\na rush to the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the\nnight. It was something even more intense than despair that I then\nobserved upon the countenance of the singular being whom I had watched\nso pertinaciously. Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with\na mad energy, retraced his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty\nLondon. Long and swiftly he fled, while I followed him in the wildest\namazement, resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an\ninterest all-absorbing. The sun arose while we proceeded, and, when we\nhad once again reached that most thronged mart of the populous town, the\nstreet of the D----- Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle\nand activity scarcely inferior to what I had seen on the evening before.\nAnd here, long, amid the momently increasing confusion, did I persist\nin my pursuit of the stranger. But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and\nduring the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that street. And,\nas the shades of the second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death,\nand, stopping fully in front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly\nin the face. He noticed me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I,\nceasing to follow, remained absorbed in contemplation. “This old man,” I\nsaid at length, “is the type and the genius of deep crime. He refuses to\nbe alone. [page 228:] He is the man of the crowd. It will be in vain to\nfollow; for I shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst\nheart of the world is a grosser book than the ‘Hortulus Animæ,’ {*1} and\nperhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ‘er lasst sich\nnicht lesen.’”\n\n","Werner Karl Heisenberg (5 December 1901 – 1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics. He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, this matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. He is known for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which he published in 1927. Heisenberg was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the creation of quantum mechanics\".\n\nHe also made important contributions to the theories of the hydrodynamics of turbulent flows, the atomic nucleus, ferromagnetism, cosmic rays, and subatomic particles, and he was instrumental in planning the first West German nuclear reactor at Karlsruhe, together with a research reactor in Munich, in 1957. He was a principal scientist in the Nazi German nuclear weapon project during World War II. He travelled to occupied Copenhagen where he met and discussed the German project with Niels Bohr.\n\nFollowing World War II, he was appointed director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which soon thereafter was renamed the Max Planck Institute for Physics. He was director of the institute until it was moved to Munich in 1958, when it was expanded and renamed the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics.\n\nHeisenberg was also president of the German Research Council, chairman of the Commission for Atomic Physics, chairman of the Nuclear Physics Working Group, and president of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\n\n\n\nWerner Karl Heisenberg was born in Würzburg, Germany, to Kaspar Ernst August Heisenberg, a secondary school teacher of classical languages who became Germany's only ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) of medieval and modern Greek studies in the university system, and his wife, Annie Wecklein.\n\nHe studied physics and mathematics from 1920 to 1923 at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Georg-August University of Göttingen. At Munich, he studied under Arnold Sommerfeld and Wilhelm Wien. At Göttingen, he studied physics with Max Born and James Franck and mathematics with David Hilbert. He received his doctorate in 1923, at Munich under Sommerfeld. At Göttingen, under Born, he completed his habilitation in 1924 with a Habilitationsschrift (habilitation thesis) on the anomalous Zeeman effect.\n\nBecause Sommerfeld had a sincere interest in his students and knew of Heisenberg's interest in Niels Bohr's theories on atomic physics, Sommerfeld took Heisenberg to Göttingen to attend the Bohr Festival of June 1922. At the event, Bohr was a guest lecturer and gave a series of comprehensive lectures on quantum atomic physics. There, Heisenberg met Bohr for the first time, and it had a significant and continuing effect on him.\n\nHeisenberg's doctoral thesis, the topic of which was suggested by Sommerfeld, was on turbulence; the thesis discussed both the stability of laminar flow and the nature of turbulent flow. The problem of stability was investigated by the use of the Orr–Sommerfeld equation, a fourth order linear differential equation for small disturbances from laminar flow. He briefly returned to this topic after World War II.\n\nIn his youth he was a member and Scoutleader of the Neupfadfinder, a German Scout association and part of the German Youth Movement. In August 1923 Robert Honsell and Heisenberg organized a trip to Finland with a Scout group of this association from Munich.\n\nHeisenberg arrived at Munich in 1919 as a member of the Freikorps to fight the Bavarian Soviet Republic established a year earlier. Five decades later he recalled those days as youthful fun, like \"playing cops and robbers and so on; it was nothing serious at all.\"\n\n\n\nFrom 1924 to 1927, Heisenberg was a Privatdozent at Göttingen, meaning he was qualified to teach and examine independently, without having a chair. From 17 September 1924 to 1 May 1925, under an International Education Board Rockefeller Foundation fellowship, Heisenberg went to do research with Niels Bohr, director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen. His seminal paper, \"Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen\" (\"Quantum theoretical re-interpretation of kinematic and mechanical relations\"), was published in September 1925. He returned to Göttingen and, with Max Born and Pascual Jordan over a period of about six months, developed the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics. On 1 May 1926, Heisenberg began his appointment as a university lecturer and assistant to Bohr in Copenhagen. It was in Copenhagen, in 1927, that Heisenberg developed his uncertainty principle, while working on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. On 23 February, Heisenberg wrote a letter to fellow physicist Wolfgang Pauli, in which he first described his new principle. In his paper on the principle, Heisenberg used the word \"Ungenauigkeit\" (imprecision), not uncertainty, to describe it.\n\nIn 1927, Heisenberg was appointed ordentlicher Professor (professor ordinarius) of theoretical physics and head of the department of physics at the University of Leipzig; he gave his inaugural lecture there on 1 February 1928. In his first paper published from Leipzig, Heisenberg used the Pauli exclusion principle to solve the mystery of ferromagnetism.\n\nDuring Heisenberg's tenure at Leipzig, the high quality of the doctoral students and post-graduate and research associates who studied and worked with him is clear from the acclaim many later earned. At various times they included Erich Bagge, Felix Bloch, Ugo Fano, Siegfried Flügge, William Vermillion Houston, Friedrich Hund, Robert S. Mulliken, Rudolf Peierls, George Placzek, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Fritz Sauter, John C. Slater, Edward Teller, John Hasbrouck van Vleck, Victor Frederick Weisskopf, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Gregor Wentzel, and Clarence Zener.\n\nIn early 1929, Heisenberg and Pauli submitted the first of two papers laying the foundation for relativistic quantum field theory. Also in 1929, Heisenberg went on a lecture tour of China, Japan, India, and the United States. In the spring of 1929, he was a visiting lecturer at the University of Chicago, where he lectured on quantum mechanics.\n\nIn 1928, the British mathematical physicist Paul Dirac had derived his relativistic wave equation of quantum mechanics, which implied the existence of positive electrons, later to be named positrons. In 1932, from a cloud chamber photograph of cosmic rays, the American physicist Carl David Anderson identified a track as having been made by a positron. In mid-1933, Heisenberg presented his theory of the positron. His thinking on Dirac's theory and further development of the theory were set forth in two papers. The first, \"Bemerkungen zur Diracschen Theorie des Positrons\" (\"Remarks on Dirac's theory of the positron\") was published in 1934, and the second, \"Folgerungen aus der Diracschen Theorie des Positrons\" (\"Consequences of Dirac's Theory of the Positron\"), was published in 1936. In these papers Heisenberg was the first to reinterpret the Dirac equation as a \"classical\" field equation for any point particle of spin ħ/2, itself subject to quantization conditions involving anti-commutators. Thus reinterpreting it as a (quantum) field equation accurately describing electrons, Heisenberg put matter on the same footing as electromagnetism: as being described by relativistic quantum field equations which allowed the possibility of particle creation and destruction. (Hermann Weyl had already described this in a 1929 letter to Albert Einstein.)\n\n\n\nHeisenberg's paper establishing quantum mechanics has puzzled physicists and historians. His methods assume that the reader is familiar with Kramers-Heisenberg transition probability calculations. The main new idea, non-commuting matrices, is justified only by a rejection of unobservable quantities. It introduces the non-commutative multiplication of matrices by physical reasoning, based on the correspondence principle, despite the fact that Heisenberg was not then familiar with the mathematical theory of matrices. The path leading to these results has been reconstructed in MacKinnon, 1977, and the detailed calculations are worked out in Aitchison et al.\n\nIn Copenhagen, Heisenberg and Hans Kramers collaborated on a paper on dispersion, or the scattering from atoms of radiation whose wavelength is larger than the atoms. They showed that the successful formula Kramers had developed earlier could not be based on Bohr orbits, because the transition frequencies are based on level spacings which are not constant. The frequencies which occur in the Fourier transform of sharp classical orbits, by contrast, are equally spaced. But these results could be explained by a semi-classical virtual state model: the incoming radiation excites the valence, or outer, electron to a virtual state from which it decays. In a subsequent paper Heisenberg showed that this virtual oscillator model could also explain the polarization of fluorescent radiation.\n\nThese two successes, and the continuing failure of the Bohr–Sommerfeld model to explain the outstanding problem of the anomalous Zeeman effect, led Heisenberg to use the virtual oscillator model to try to calculate spectral frequencies. The method proved too difficult to immediately apply to realistic problems, so Heisenberg turned to a simpler example, the anharmonic oscillator.\n\nThe dipole oscillator consists of a simple harmonic oscillator, which is thought of as a charged particle on a spring, perturbed by an external force, like an external charge. The motion of the oscillating charge can be expressed as a Fourier series in the frequency of the oscillator. Heisenberg solved for the quantum behavior by two different methods. First, he treated the system with the virtual oscillator method, calculating the transitions between the levels that would be produced by the external source.\n\nHe then solved the same problem by treating the anharmonic potential term as a perturbation to the harmonic oscillator and using the perturbation methods that he and Born had developed. Both methods led to the same results for the first and the very complicated second order correction terms. This suggested that behind the very complicated calculations lay a consistent scheme.\n\nSo Heisenberg set out to formulate these results without any explicit dependence on the virtual oscillator model. To do this, he replaced the Fourier expansions for the spatial coordinates by matrices, matrices which corresponded to the transition coefficients in the virtual oscillator method. He justified this replacement by an appeal to Bohr's correspondence principle and the Pauli doctrine that quantum mechanics must be limited to observables.\n\nOn 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born this paper to review and submit for publication. When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University. Born, with the help of his assistant and former student Pascual Jordan, began immediately to make the transcription and extension, and they submitted their results for publication; the paper was received for publication just 60 days after Heisenberg's paper. A follow-on paper was submitted for publication before the end of the year by all three authors.\n\nUp until this time, matrices were seldom used by physicists; they were considered to belong to the realm of pure mathematics. Gustav Mie had used them in a paper on electrodynamics in 1912 and Born had used them in his work on the lattice theory of crystals in 1921. While matrices were used in these cases, the algebra of matrices with their multiplication did not enter the picture as they did in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn 1928, Albert Einstein nominated Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan for the Nobel Prize in Physics, The announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 was delayed until November 1933. It was at that time that it was announced Heisenberg had won the Prize for 1932 \"for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen\".\n\nShortly after the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, Heisenberg submitted the first of three papers on his neutron-proton model of the nucleus. After Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Heisenberg was attacked in the press as a \"White Jew\". Supporters of Deutsche Physik, or Aryan Physics, launched vicious attacks against leading theoretical physicists, including Arnold Sommerfeld and Heisenberg. From the early 1930s onward, the anti-Semitic and anti-theoretical physics movement Deutsche Physik had concerned itself with quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. As applied in the university environment, political factors took priority over the historically applied concept of scholarly ability, even though its two most prominent supporters were the Nobel Laureates in Physics Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark.\n\nThere had been many failed attempts to have Heisenberg appointed as professor at a variety of German universities. His attempt to be appointed as the successor to Arnold Sommerfeld failed because of opposition by the Deutsche Physik movement. On 1 April 1935, the eminent theoretical physicist Sommerfeld, Heisenberg's doctoral advisor at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, achieved emeritus status. However, Sommerfeld stayed in his chair during the selection process for his successor, which took until 1 December 1939. The process was lengthy due to academic and political differences between the Munich Faculty's selection and that of the Reichserziehungsministerium (Reich Education Ministry) and the supporters of Deutsche Physik.\n\nIn 1935, the Munich Faculty drew up a list of candidates to replace Sommerfeld as ordinarius professor of theoretical physics and head of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Munich. The three candidates had all been former students of Sommerfeld: Heisenberg, who had received the Nobel Prize in Physics; Peter Debye, who had received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1936; and Richard Becker. The Munich Faculty was firmly behind these candidates, with Heisenberg as their first choice. However, supporters of Deutsche Physik and elements in the REM had their own list of candidates, and the battle dragged on for over four years. During this time, Heisenberg came under vicious attack by the Deutsche Physik supporters. One attack was published in Das Schwarze Korps, the newspaper of the Schutzstaffel (SS), headed by Heinrich Himmler. In this, Heisenberg was called a \"White Jew\" (i.e. an Aryan who acts like a Jew) who should be made to \"disappear\". These attacks were taken seriously, as Jews were violently attacked and incarcerated. Heisenberg fought back with an editorial and a letter to Himmler, in an attempt to resolve the matter and regain his honour.\n\nAt one point, Heisenberg's mother visited Himmler's mother. The two women knew each other, as Heisenberg's maternal grandfather and Himmler's father were rectors and members of a Bavarian hiking club. Eventually, Himmler settled the Heisenberg affair by sending two letters, one to SS Gruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich and one to Heisenberg, both on 21 July 1938. In the letter to Heydrich, Himmler said Germany could not afford to lose or silence Heisenberg, as he would be useful for teaching a generation of scientists. To Heisenberg, Himmler said the letter came on recommendation of his family and he cautioned Heisenberg to make a distinction between professional physics research results and the personal and political attitudes of the involved scientists.\n\nWilhelm Müller replaced Sommerfeld at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Müller was not a theoretical physicist, had not published in a physics journal, and was not a member of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft; his appointment was considered a travesty and detrimental to educating theoretical physicists.\n\nThe three investigators who led the SS investigation of Heisenberg had training in physics—Heisenberg had participated in the doctoral examination of one of them at the Universität Leipzig. The most influential of the three was Johannes Juilfs. During their investigation, they became supporters of Heisenberg as well as his position against the ideological policies of the Deutsche Physik movement in theoretical physics and academia.\n\nOn 29 June 1936, a Nazi Party newspaper published a column attacking Heisenberg. On 15 July 1937, he was attacked in a journal of the SS. In mid-1936, Heisenberg presented his theory of cosmic-ray showers in two papers. Four more papers   appeared in the next two years. In December 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann sent a manuscript to Naturwissenschaften reporting they had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons and Otto Hahn concluded a bursting of the uranium nucleus; simultaneously, Hahn communicated these results to his friend Lise Meitner, who had in July of that year fled to the Netherlands and then went to Sweden. Meitner, and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, correctly interpreted Hahn's and Strassmann's results as being nuclear fission. Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939.\n\nIn June 1939, Heisenberg bought a summer home for his family in Urfeld am Walchensee, in southern Germany. He also traveled to the United States in June and July, visiting Samuel Abraham Goudsmit at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. However, Heisenberg refused an invitation to emigrate to the United States. He did not see Goudsmit again until six years later, when Goudsmit was the chief scientific advisor to the American Operation Alsos at the close of World War II.\n\nThe German nuclear weapons program, known as Uranverein, was formed on 1 September 1939, the day World War II began. The Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) had squeezed the Reichsforschungsrat (RFR, Reich Research Council) out of the Reichserziehungsministerium (REM, Reich Ministry of Education) and started the formal German nuclear energy project under military auspices. The project had its first meeting on 16 September 1939. The meeting was organized by Kurt Diebner, advisor to the HWA, and held in Berlin. The invitees included Walther Bothe, Siegfried Flügge, Hans Geiger, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Gerhard Hoffmann, Josef Mattauch and Georg Stetter. A second meeting was held soon thereafter and included Heisenberg, Klaus Clusius, Robert Döpel and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. The Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) in Berlin-Dahlem, was placed under HWA authority, with Diebner as the administrative director, and the military control of the nuclear research commenced. During the period Diebner administered the KWIP under the HWA program, considerable personal and professional animosity developed between Diebner and Heisenberg's inner circle, which included Karl Wirtz, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker.\n\nAt a scientific conference on 26–28 February 1942 at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, called by the Army Weapons Office, Heisenberg presented a lecture to Reichs officials on energy acquisition from nuclear fission. The lecture, entitled \"Die theoretischen Grundlagen für die Energiegewinning aus der Uranspaltung\" was, as Heisenberg confessed after the Second World War in a letter to Samuel Goudsmit, \"adapted to the intellectual level of a Reichs Minister\". Heisenberg lectured on the enormous energy potential of nuclear fission, stating that 250 million electron volts could be released through the fission of an atomic nucleus. Heisenberg stressed that pure U-235 had to be obtained to achieve a chain reaction. He explored various ways of obtaining isotope 235 U/92 in its pure from, including uranium enrichment and an alternative layered method of normal uranium and a moderator in a machine. This machine, he noted, could be used in practical ways to fuel vehicles, ships and submarines. Heisenberg stressed the importance of the Army Weapons Office's financial and material support for this scientific endeavour. A second scientific conference followed. Lectures were heard on problems of modern physics with decisive importance for the national defense and economy. The conference was attended by Bernhard Rust, the Reichs Minister of Science, Education and National Culture. At the conference Reichs Minister Rust decided to take the nuclear project away from the Kaiser Wilhelm Society. The Reichs Research Council was to take on the project. In April 1942 the army returned the Physics Institute to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, naming Heisenberg as Director at the Institute. With this appointment at the KWIP, Heisenberg obtained his first professorship. Peter Debye was still director of the institute, but had gone on leave to the United States after he had refused to become a German citizen when the HWA took administrative control of the KWIP. Heisenberg still also had his department of physics at the University of Leipzig where work had been done for the Uranverein by Robert Döpel and his wife Klara Döpel.\n\nOn 4 June 1942, Heisenberg was summoned to report to Albert Speer, Germany's Minister of Armaments, on the prospects for converting the Uranverein's research toward developing nuclear weapons. During the meeting, Heisenberg told Speer that a bomb could not be built before 1945, because it would require significant monetary resources and number of personnel.\n\nAfter the Uranverein project was placed under the leadership of the Reichs Research Council, it focused on nuclear power production and thus maintained its kriegswichtig (importance for the war) status; funding therefore continued from the military. The nuclear power project was broken down into the following main areas: uranium and heavy water production, uranium isotope separation and the Uranmaschine (uranium machine, i.e., nuclear reactor). The project was then essentially split up between a number of institutes, where the directors dominated the research and set their own research agendas. The point in 1942, when the army relinquished its control of the German nuclear weapons program, was the zenith of the project relative to the number of personnel. About 70 scientists worked for the program, with about 40 devoting more than half their time to nuclear fission research. After 1942, the number of scientists working on applied nuclear fission diminished dramatically. Many of the scientists not working with the main institutes stopped working on nuclear fission and devoted their efforts to more pressing war related work.\n\nIn September 1942, Heisenberg submitted his first paper of a three-part series on the scattering matrix, or S-matrix, in elementary particle physics. The first two papers were published in 1943 and the third in 1944. The S-matrix described only the states of incident particles in a collision process, the states of those emerging from the collision, and stable bound states; there would be no reference to the intervening states. This was the same precedent as he followed in 1925 in what turned out to be the foundation of the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics through only the use of observables.\n\nIn February 1943, Heisenberg was appointed to the Chair for Theoretical Physics at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität (today, the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin). In April, his election to the Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften (Prussian Academy of Sciences) was approved. That same month, he moved his family to their retreat in Urfeld as Allied bombing increased in Berlin. In the summer, he dispatched the first of his staff at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik to Hechingen and its neighboring town of Haigerloch, on the edge of the Black Forest, for the same reasons. From 18–26 October, he travelled to German-occupied Netherlands. In December 1943, Heisenberg visited German-occupied Poland.\n\nFrom 24 January to 4 February 1944, Heisenberg travelled to occupied Copenhagen, after the German army confiscated Bohr's Institute of Theoretical Physics. He made a short return trip in April. In December, Heisenberg lectured in neutral Switzerland. The United States Office of Strategic Services sent agent Moe Berg to attend the lecture carrying a pistol, with orders to shoot Heisenberg if his lecture indicated that Germany was close to completing an atomic bomb.\n\nIn January 1945, Heisenberg, with most of the rest of his staff, moved from the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik to the facilities in the Black Forest.\n\n\n\nThe Alsos Mission was an Allied effort to determine if the Germans had an atomic bomb program and to exploit German atomic related facilities, research, material resources, and scientific personnel for the benefit of the US. Personnel on this operation generally swept into areas which had just come under control of the Allied military forces, but sometimes they operated in areas still under control by German forces. Berlin had been a location of many German scientific research facilities. To limit casualties and loss of equipment, many of these facilities were dispersed to other locations in the latter years of the war. The Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) had been bombed so it had mostly been moved in 1943 and 1944 to Hechingen and its neighboring town of Haigerloch, on the edge of the Black Forest, which eventually became the French occupation zone. This allowed the American task force of the Alsos Mission to take into custody a large number of German scientists associated with nuclear research.\n\nOn 30 March, the Alsos Mission reached Heidelberg, where important scientists were captured including Walther Bothe, Richard Kuhn, Philipp Lenard, and Wolfgang Gertner. Their interrogation revealed that Otto Hahn was at his laboratory in Tailfingen, while Heisenberg and Max von Laue were at Heisenberg's laboratory in Hechingen, and that the experimental natural uranium reactor that Heisenberg's team had built in Berlin had been moved to Haigerloch. Henceforth, the main focus of the Alsos Mission was on these nuclear facilities in the Württemberg area. Heisenberg was captured and arrested in Urfeld, on 3 May 1945, in an alpine operation in territory still under control by German forces. He was taken to Heidelberg, where, on 5 May, he met Goudsmit for the first time since the Ann Arbor visit in 1939. Germany surrendered just two days later. Heisenberg would not see his family again for eight months, as he was moved across France and Belgium and flown to England on 3 July 1945.\n\nNine of the prominent German scientists who published reports in Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte as members of the Uranverein were captured by Operation Alsos and incarcerated in England under Operation Epsilon. 10 German scientists, including Heisenberg, were held at Farm Hall in England. The facility had been a safe house of the British foreign intelligence MI6. During their detention, their conversations were recorded. Conversations thought to be of intelligence value were transcribed and translated into English. The transcripts were released in 1992. On the 6th of August 1945 the scientists at Farm Hall learned from media reports that the USA had dropped an atomic bomb in Hiroshima, Japan. At first there was disbelief that a bomb had been built and dropped. In the weeks that followed, the German scientists discussed how the USA may have built the bomb.\n\nThe Farm Hall transcripts reveal that Heisenberg, along with other physicists interned at Farm Hall including Otto Hahn and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, were glad the Allies had won World War II. Heisenberg told scientists that he had never contemplated a bomb, only an atomic pile to produce energy. The morality of creating a bomb for the Nazis was also discussed. Only a few of the scientists expressed genuine horror at the prospect of nuclear weapons, and Heisenberg himself was cautious in discussing the matter. On the failure of the German nuclear weapons program to build an atomic bomb, Heisenberg remarked: \"We wouldn't have had the moral courage to recommend to the Government in the spring of 1942 that they should employ 120,000 men just for building the thing up.\"\n\nOn 3 January 1946, the 10 Operation Epsilon detainees were transported to Alswede in Germany, which was in the British occupation zone. Heisenberg settled in Göttingen, also in the British zone. In July, he was named director of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics), then located in Göttingen. Shortly thereafter, it was renamed the Max Planck Institut für Physik, in honor of Max Planck and to assuage political objections to the continuation of the institute.\n\nIn 1949, the Deutsche Forschungsrat (German Research Council) was established by the Max-Planck Gesellschaft (MPG, Max Planck Society, successor organization to the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft). Heisenberg was appointed president of the Deutsche Forschungsrat. In 1951, the organization was fused with the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft (NG, Emergency Association of German Science) and that same year renamed the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation). With the merger, Heisenberg was appointed to the presidium.\n\nIn 1952, Heisenberg served as the chairman of the Commission for Atomic Physics of the DFG. Also that year, he headed the German delegation to the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN). In 1953, Heisenberg was appointed president of the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung by Konrad Adenauer. Heisenberg served until 1975. Also, from 1953, Heisenberg's theoretical work concentrated on the unified field theory of elementary particles.\n\nIn 1958 the Max-Planck-Institut für Physik was moved to Munich, expanded, and renamed Max-Planck-Institut für Physik und Astrophysik (MPIFA). In the interim, Heisenberg and the astrophysicist Ludwig Biermann were co-directors of MPIFA. Heisenberg also became an ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. Heisenberg was the sole director of MPIFA from 1960 to 1970. Heisenberg resigned his directorship of the MPIFA on 31 December 1970.\n\nIn 1946 the German scientist Heinz Pose, head of Laboratory V in Obninsk, wrote a letter to Heisenberg inviting him to work in the USSR. The letter lauded the working conditions in the USSR and the available resources, as well as the favorable attitude of the Soviets towards German scientists. A courier hand delivered the recruitment letter, dated 18 July 1946, to Heisenberg; Heisenberg politely declined. In 1947, Heisenberg presented lectures in Cambridge, Edinburgh and Bristol. Heisenberg contributed to the understanding of the phenomenon of superconductivity with a paper in 1947 and two papers in 1948, one of them with Max von Laue.\n\nIn the period shortly after World War II, Heisenberg briefly returned to the subject of his doctoral thesis, turbulence. Three papers were published in 1948  and one in 1950. In the post-war period Heisenberg continued his interests in cosmic-ray showers with considerations on multiple production of mesons. He published three papers  in 1949, two  in 1952, and one in 1955.\n\nIn late 1955 to early 1956, Heisenberg gave the Gifford Lectures at St Andrews University, in Scotland, on the intellectual history of physics. The lectures were later published as Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science. During 1956 and 1957, Heisenberg was the chairman of the Arbeitskreis Kernphysik (Nuclear Physics Working Group) of the Fachkommission II \"Forschung und Nachwuchs\" (Commission II \"Research and Growth\") of the Deutschen Atomkommission (DAtK, German Atomic Energy Commission). Other members of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in both 1956 and 1957 were: Walther Bothe, Hans Kopfermann (vice-chairman), Fritz Bopp, Wolfgang Gentner, Otto Haxel, Willibald Jentschke, Heinz Maier-Leibnitz, Josef Mattauch, Wolfgang Riezler, Wilhelm Walcher and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. Wolfgang Paul was also a member of the group during 1957.\n\nIn 1957, Heisenberg was a signatory of the Declaration of the German Nuclear Physicists of the Göttinger Achtzehn (Göttingen Eighteen). From 1957, Heisenberg was interested in plasma physics and the process of nuclear fusion. He also collaborated with the International Institute of Atomic Physics in Geneva. He was a member of the Institute's Scientific Policy Committee, and for several years was the Committee's chairman. He was one of the eight signatories of the Memorandum of Tübingen which called for the recognition of the Oder-Neiße line as the official border between Germany and Poland and spoke against a possible nuclear armament of West Germany.\n\nIn 1973, Heisenberg gave a lecture at Harvard University on the historical development of the concepts of quantum theory. On 24 March 1973, Heisenberg gave a speech before the Catholic Academy of Bavaria, accepting the Romano Guardini Prize. An English translation of its title is \"Scientific and Religious Truth\". Its stated goal was \"In what follows, then, we shall first of all deal with the unassailability and value of scientific truth, and then with the much wider field of religion, of which—so far as the Christian religion is concerned—Guardini himself has so persuasively written; finally—and this will be the hardest part to formulate—we shall speak of the relationship of the two truths.\"\n\nIn January 1937 Heisenberg met Elisabeth Schumacher (1914–1998) at a private music recital. Elisabeth was the daughter of a well-known Berlin economics professor, and her brother was the economist E. F. Schumacher, author of Small Is Beautiful. Heisenberg married her on 29 April. Fraternal twins Maria and Wolfgang were born in January 1938, whereupon Wolfgang Pauli congratulated Heisenberg on his \"pair creation\"—a word play on a process from elementary particle physics, pair production. They had five more children over the next 12 years: Barbara, Christine, Jochen, Martin and Verena. Martin became a neurobiologist at the University of Würzburg and Jochen a physics professor at the University of New Hampshire. Heisenberg enjoyed classical music and was an accomplished pianist.\n\nHeisenberg was raised and lived as a Lutheran Christian. His autobiography starts with the young Heisenberg in his late teenage years, reading Plato's Timaeus while hiking in the Bavarian Alps. Heisenberg recounted the philosophical conversations with his fellow students and teachers on understanding the atom while receiving his scientific training in Munich, Göttingen and Copenhagen.\n\nIn his speech Scientific and Religious Truth (1974) while accepting the Romano Guardini Prize, Heisenberg affirmed:\n\n\"In the history of science, ever since the famous trial of Galileo, it has repeatedly been claimed that scientific truth cannot be reconciled with the religious interpretation of the world. Although I am now convinced that scientific truth is unassailable in its own field, I have never found it possible to dismiss the content of religious thinking as simply part of an outmoded phase in the consciousness of mankind, a part we shall have to give up from now on. Thus in the course of my life I have repeatedly been compelled to ponder on the relationship of these two regions of thought, for I have never been able to doubt the reality of that to which they point.\"\n\n- Heisenberg 1974, 213\n\n\"Where no guiding ideals are left to point the way, the scale of values disappears and with it the meaning of our deeds and sufferings, and at the end can lie only negation and despair. Religion is therefore the foundation of ethics, and ethics the presupposition of life.\"\n\n- Heisenberg 1974, 219\n\nIn his late-sixties Heisenberg penned his autobiography for the mass market. In 1969 the book was published in Germany, in early 1971 it was published in English and in the years thereafter in a string of other languages. Heisenberg had initiated the project in 1966, when his public lectures increasingly turned to the subjects of philosophy and religion. Heisenberg had sent the publishers Hirzel and Wiley the manuscript for a textbook on the unified field theory. This manuscript, he wrote to one of his publishers, was the preparatory work for his autobiography. He structured his autobiography in themes, covering: 1) The goal of exact science, 2) The problematic of language in atomic physics, 3) Abstraction in mathematics and science, 4) The divisibility of matter or Kant's antinomy, 5) The basic symmetry and its substantiation, and 6) Science and religion.\n\nHeisenberg wrote his memoirs as a chain of conversations, covering the course of his life. The book became a popular success, but was regarded as troublesome by historians of science. In the preface Heisenberg wrote that he had abridged historical events, to make them more concise. At the time of publication it was reviewed by Paul Forman in the journal Science with the comment \"Now here is a memoir in the form of rationally reconstructed dialogue. And the dialogue as Galileo well knew, is itself a most insidious literary device: lively, entertaining, and especially suited for insinuating opinions while yet evading responsibility for them.\" Few scientific memoirs had been published, but Konrad Lorenz and Adolf Portmann had penned popular books that conveyed scholarship to a wide audience. Heisenberg worked on his autobiography with the publisher Piper in Munich and initially proposed the title Gespräche im Umkreis der Atomphysik (Conversations around atomic physics). He settled with his publisher on Der Teil und das Ganze (The part and the whole). An English translation under the title Physics and Beyond: Encounters and Conversations was published in 1971.\n\nHeisenberg died of cancer of the kidneys and gallbladder at his home, on 1 February 1976. The next evening, his colleagues and friends walked in remembrance from the Institute of Physics to his home and each put a candle near the front door. He is buried at Munich Waldfriedhof.\n\n","ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.  He had\nbright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long\nbit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the\npond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who\nwas pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand\non their heads in the water.\n\n“You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your\nheads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them\nhow it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They\nwere so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in\nsociety at all.\n\n“What disobedient children!” cried the old Water-rat; “they really\ndeserve to be drowned.”\n\n“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a\nbeginning, and parents cannot be too patient.”\n\n“Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the Water-rat;\n“I am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never\nintend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much\nhigher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or\nrarer than a devoted friendship.”\n\n“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?” asked a\nGreen Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard\nthe conversation.\n\n“Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam away\nto the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her\nchildren a good example.\n\n“What a silly question!” cried the Water-rat.  “I should expect my\ndevoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.”\n\n“And what would you do in return?” said the little bird, swinging upon a\nsilver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.\n\n“I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat.\n\n“Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Is the story about me?” asked the Water-rat.  “If so, I will listen to\nit, for I am extremely fond of fiction.”\n\n“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and\nalighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.\n\n“Once upon a time,” said the Linnet, “there was an honest little fellow\nnamed Hans.”\n\n“Was he very distinguished?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“No,” answered the Linnet, “I don’t think he was distinguished at all,\nexcept for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He\nlived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his\ngarden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.\nSweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds’-purses, and\nFair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac\nCrocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock,\nMarjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil\nand the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the\nmonths went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there\nwere always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.\n\n“Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all\nwas big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to\nlittle Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over\nthe wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or\nfilling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.\n\n“‘Real friends should have everything in common,’ the Miller used to say,\nand little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend\nwith such noble ideas.\n\n“Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich\nMiller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred\nsacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large\nflock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these\nthings, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the\nwonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true\nfriendship.\n\n“So little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the\nsummer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and\nhe had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good\ndeal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper\nbut a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was\nextremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.\n\n“‘There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow\nlasts,’ the Miller used to say to his wife, ‘for when people are in\ntrouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That\nat least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I\nshall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and\nhe will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make\nhim so happy.’\n\n“‘You are certainly very thoughtful about others,’ answered the Wife, as\nshe sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ‘very\nthoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about\nfriendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful\nthings as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear\na gold ring on his little finger.’\n\n“‘But could we not ask little Hans up here?’ said the Miller’s youngest\nson.  ‘If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and\nshow him my white rabbits.’\n\n“‘What a silly boy you are!’ cried the Miller; ‘I really don’t know what\nis the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything.\nWhy, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good\nsupper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is\na most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature.  I certainly\nwill not allow Hans’ nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I\nwill always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any\ntemptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have\nsome flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and\nfriendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words\nare spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can\nsee that.’\n\n“‘How well you talk!’ said the Miller’s Wife, pouring herself out a large\nglass of warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in\nchurch.’\n\n“‘Lots of people act well,’ answered the Miller; ‘but very few people\ntalk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of\nthe two, and much the finer thing also’; and he looked sternly across the\ntable at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his\nhead down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.\nHowever, he was so young that you must excuse him.”\n\n“Is that the end of the story?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Certainly not,” answered the Linnet, “that is the beginning.”\n\n“Then you are quite behind the age,” said the Water-rat.  “Every good\nstory-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the\nbeginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I\nheard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the\npond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am\nsure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head,\nand whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ‘Pooh!’\nBut pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all\nkinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy\nbetween us.”\n\n“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, “as\nsoon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale\nyellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see\nlittle Hans.\n\n“‘Why, what a good heart you have!’ cried his Wife; ‘you are always\nthinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the\nflowers.’\n\n“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron\nchain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.\n\n“‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to\near.\n\n“‘And how have you been all the winter?’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very good\nindeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring\nhas come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.’\n\n“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and\nwondered how you were getting on.’\n\n“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten\nme.’\n\n“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never\nforgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t\nunderstand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking,\nby-the-bye!”\n\n“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky\nthing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the\nmarket and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my\nwheelbarrow with the money.’\n\n“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don’t mean to say you have sold it?\nWhat a very stupid thing to do!’\n\n“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to.  You see the\nwinter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to\nbuy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,\nand then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last\nI sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.’\n\n“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in\nvery good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong\nwith the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I\nknow it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me\nextremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the\nworld.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,\nbesides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your\nmind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.’\n\n“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his funny\nround face glowed all over with pleasure.  ‘I can easily put it in\nrepair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.’\n\n“‘A plank of wood!’ said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want for\nthe roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will\nall get damp if I don’t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is\nquite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given\nyou my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of\ncourse, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,\nfriendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I\nwill set to work at my barn this very day.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the\nplank out.\n\n“‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I am\nafraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left for\nyou to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.\nAnd now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to\ngive me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it\nquite full.’\n\n“‘Quite full?’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a\nvery big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no\nflowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver\nbuttons back.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘as I have given you my\nwheelbarrow, I don’t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.\nI may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true\nfriendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.’\n\n“‘My dear friend, my best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you are welcome to\nall the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion\nthan my silver buttons, any day’; and he ran and plucked all his pretty\nprimroses, and filled the Miller’s basket.\n\n“‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said the Miller, as he went up the hill with\nthe plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.\n\n“‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he\nwas so pleased about the wheelbarrow.\n\n“The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when\nhe heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped\noff the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.\n\n“There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this sack\nof flour for me to market?’\n\n“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day.  I\nhave got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all\nmy grass to roll.’\n\n“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I am\ngoing to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to\nrefuse.’\n\n“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly for\nthe whole world’; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big\nsack on his shoulders.\n\n“It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans\nhad reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down\nand rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the\nmarket.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour\nfor a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was\nafraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.\n\n“‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as he\nwas going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is\nmy best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.’\n\n“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his\nsack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.\n\n“‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy.  Really,\nconsidering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might\nwork harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of\nmy friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite\nplainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not\nyour friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say\nexactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to\nplease and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,\nand does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he\nprefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off\nhis night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for\na little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I\nalways work better after hearing the birds sing?’\n\n“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the\nback, ‘for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed,\nand mend my barn-roof for me.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his\nflowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse\nthe Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.\n\n“‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?’ he\ninquired in a shy and timid voice.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to ask\nof you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of\ncourse if you refuse I will go and do it myself.’\n\n“‘Oh! on no account,’ cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and\ndressed himself, and went up to the barn.\n\n“He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came\nto see how he was getting on.\n\n“‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?’ cried the\nMiller in a cheery voice.\n\n“‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.\n\n“‘Ah!’ said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work one\ndoes for others.’\n\n“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered little\nHans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ‘a very great privilege.\nBut I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.’\n\n“‘Oh! they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take more\npains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you\nwill have the theory also.’\n\n“‘Do you really think I shall?’ asked little Hans.\n\n“‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered the Miller, ‘but now that you have\nmended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive\nmy sheep to the mountain to-morrow.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next\nmorning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans\nstarted off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get\nthere and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to\nsleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.\n\n“‘What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,’ he said, and he went\nto work at once.\n\n“But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his\nfriend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long\nerrands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much\ndistressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had\nforgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller\nwas his best friend.  ‘Besides,’ he used to say, ‘he is going to give me\nhis wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.’\n\n“So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds\nof beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a\nnote-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good\nscholar.\n\n“Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside\nwhen a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind\nwas blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he\nthought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a\nthird, louder than any of the others.\n\n“‘It is some poor traveller,’ said little Hans to himself, and he ran to\nthe door.\n\n“There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the\nother.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ cried the Miller, ‘I am in great trouble.  My little\nboy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the\nDoctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it\nhas just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead\nof me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is\nonly fair that you should do something for me in return.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take it quite as a compliment your\ncoming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your\nlantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the\nditch.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ answered the Miller, ‘but it is my new lantern, and\nit would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.’\n\n“‘Well, never mind, I will do without it,’ cried little Hans, and he took\ndown his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler\nround his throat, and started off.\n\n“What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans\ncould hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely\nstand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking\nabout three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the\ndoor.\n\n“‘Who is there?’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom\nwindow.\n\n“‘Little Hans, Doctor.’\n\n“’What do you want, little Hans?’\n\n“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and\nthe Miller wants you to come at once.’\n\n“‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big\nboots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the\ndirection of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him.\n\n“But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and\nlittle Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.\nAt last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very\ndangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans\nwas drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating\nin a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.\n\n“Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and the\nMiller was the chief mourner.\n\n“‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I\nshould have the best place’; so he walked at the head of the procession\nin a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a\nbig pocket-handkerchief.\n\n“‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the\nBlacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated\ncomfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.\n\n“‘A great loss to me at any rate,’ answered the Miller; ‘why, I had as\ngood as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don’t know what to do\nwith it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair\nthat I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take\ncare not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being\ngenerous.’”\n\n“Well?” said the Water-rat, after a long pause.\n\n“Well, that is the end,” said the Linnet.\n\n“But what became of the Miller?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Oh!  I really don’t know,” replied the Linnet; “and I am sure that I\ndon’t care.”\n\n“It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,” said\nthe Water-rat.\n\n“I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the\nLinnet.\n\n“The what?” screamed the Water-rat.\n\n“The moral.”\n\n“Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Well, really,” said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, “I think you\nshould have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I\ncertainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said\n‘Pooh,’ like the critic.  However, I can say it now”; so he shouted out\n“Pooh” at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back\ninto his hole.\n\n“And how do you like the Water-rat?” asked the Duck, who came paddling up\nsome minutes afterwards.  “He has a great many good points, but for my\nown part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed\nbachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.”\n\n“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet.  “The\nfact is, that I told him a story with a moral.”\n\n“Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,” said the Duck.\n\nAnd I quite agree with her.\n\n","'I shall never forget Tony's face.  'Twas a little, round, firm, tight\nface, with a seam here and there left by the smallpox, but not enough to\nhurt his looks in a woman's eye, though he'd had it badish when he was a\nboy.  So very serious looking and unsmiling 'a was, that young man, that\nit really seemed as if he couldn't laugh at all without great pain to his\nconscience.  He looked very hard at a small speck in your eye when\ntalking to 'ee.  And there was no more sign of a whisker or beard on Tony\nKytes's face than on the palm of my hand.  He used to sing \"The Tailor's\nBreeches\" with a religious manner, as if it were a hymn:--\n\n'\"O the petticoats went off, and the breeches they went on!\"\n\nand all the rest of the scandalous stuff.  He was quite the women's\nfavourite, and in return for their likings he loved 'em in shoals.\n\n'But in course of time Tony got fixed down to one in particular, Milly\nRichards, a nice, light, small, tender little thing; and it was soon said\nthat they were engaged to be married.  One Saturday he had been to market\nto do business for his father, and was driving home the waggon in the\nafternoon.  When he reached the foot of the very hill we shall be going\nover in ten minutes who should he see waiting for him at the top but\nUnity Sallet, a handsome girl, one of the young women he'd been very\ntender toward before he'd got engaged to Milly.\n\n'As soon as Tony came up to her she said, \"My dear Tony, will you give me\na lift home?\"\n\n'\"That I will, darling,\" said Tony.  \"You don't suppose I could refuse\n'ee?\"\n\n'She smiled a smile, and up she hopped, and on drove Tony.\n\n'\"Tony,\" she says, in a sort of tender chide, \"why did ye desert me for\nthat other one?  In what is she better than I?  I should have made 'ee a\nfiner wife, and a more loving one too.  'Tisn't girls that are so easily\nwon at first that are the best.  Think how long we've known each\nother--ever since we were children almost--now haven't we, Tony?\"\n\n'\"Yes, that we have,\" says Tony, a-struck with the truth o't.\n\n'\"And you've never seen anything in me to complain of, have ye, Tony?  Now\ntell the truth to me?\"\n\n'\"I never have, upon my life,\" says Tony.\n\n'\"And--can you say I'm not pretty, Tony?  Now look at me!\"\n\n'He let his eyes light upon her for a long while.  \"I really can't,\" says\nhe.  \"In fact, I never knowed you was so pretty before!\"\n\n'\"Prettier than she?\"\n\n'What Tony would have said to that nobody knows, for before he could\nspeak, what should he see ahead, over the hedge past the turning, but a\nfeather he knew well--the feather in Milly's hat--she to whom he had been\nthinking of putting the question as to giving out the banns that very\nweek.\n\n'\"Unity,\" says he, as mild as he could, \"here's Milly coming.  Now I\nshall catch it mightily if she sees 'ee riding here with me; and if you\nget down she'll be turning the corner in a moment, and, seeing 'ee in the\nroad, she'll know we've been coming on together.  Now, dearest Unity,\nwill ye, to avoid all unpleasantness, which I know ye can't bear any more\nthan I, will ye lie down in the back part of the waggon, and let me cover\nyou over with the tarpaulin till Milly has passed?  It will all be done\nin a minute.  Do!--and I'll think over what we've said; and perhaps I\nshall put a loving question to you after all, instead of to Milly.\n'Tisn't true that it is all settled between her and me.\"\n\n'Well, Unity Sallet agreed, and lay down at the back end of the waggon,\nand Tony covered her over, so that the waggon seemed to be empty but for\nthe loose tarpaulin; and then he drove on to meet Milly.\n\n'\"My dear Tony!\" cries Milly, looking up with a little pout at him as he\ncame near.  \"How long you've been coming home!  Just as if I didn't live\nat Upper Longpuddle at all!  And I've come to meet you as you asked me to\ndo, and to ride back with you, and talk over our future home--since you\nasked me, and I promised.  But I shouldn't have come else, Mr. Tony!\"\n\n'\"Ay, my dear, I did ask ye--to be sure I did, now I think of it--but I\nhad quite forgot it.  To ride back with me, did you say, dear Milly?\"\n\n'\"Well, of course!  What can I do else?  Surely you don't want me to\nwalk, now I've come all this way?\"\n\n'\"O no, no!  I was thinking you might be going on to town to meet your\nmother.  I saw her there--and she looked as if she might be expecting\n'ee.\"\n\n'\"O no; she's just home.  She came across the fields, and so got back\nbefore you.\"\n\n'\"Ah!  I didn't know that,\" says Tony.  And there was no help for it but\nto take her up beside him.\n\n'They talked on very pleasantly, and looked at the trees, and beasts, and\nbirds, and insects, and at the ploughmen at work in the fields, till\npresently who should they see looking out of the upper window of a house\nthat stood beside the road they were following, but Hannah Jolliver,\nanother young beauty of the place at that time, and the very first woman\nthat Tony had fallen in love with--before Milly and before Unity, in\nfact--the one that he had almost arranged to marry instead of Milly.  She\nwas a much more dashing girl than Milly Richards, though he'd not thought\nmuch of her of late.  The house Hannah was looking from was her aunt's.\n\n'\"My dear Milly--my coming wife, as I may call 'ee,\" says Tony in his\nmodest way, and not so loud that Unity could overhear, \"I see a young\nwoman alooking out of window, who I think may accost me.  The fact is,\nMilly, she had a notion that I was wishing to marry her, and since she's\ndiscovered I've promised another, and a prettier than she, I'm rather\nafeard of her temper if she sees us together.  Now, Milly, would you do\nme a favour--my coming wife, as I may say?\"\n\n'\"Certainly, dearest Tony,\" says she.\n\n'\"Then would ye creep under the empty sacks just here in the front of the\nwaggon, and hide there out of sight till we've passed the house?  She\nhasn't seen us yet.  You see, we ought to live in peace and good-will\nsince 'tis almost Christmas, and 'twill prevent angry passions rising,\nwhich we always should do.\"\n\n'\"I don't mind, to oblige you, Tony,\" Milly said; and though she didn't\ncare much about doing it, she crept under, and crouched down just behind\nthe seat, Unity being snug at the other end.  So they drove on till they\ngot near the road-side cottage.  Hannah had soon seen him coming, and\nwaited at the window, looking down upon him.  She tossed her head a\nlittle disdainful and smiled off-hand.\n\n'\"Well, aren't you going to be civil enough to ask me to ride home with\nyou!\" she says, seeing that he was for driving past with a nod and a\nsmile.\n\n'\"Ah, to be sure!  What was I thinking of?\" said Tony, in a flutter.  \"But\nyou seem as if you was staying at your aunt's?\"\n\n'\"No, I am not,\" she said.  \"Don't you see I have my bonnet and jacket\non?  I have only called to see her on my way home.  How can you be so\nstupid, Tony?\"\n\n'\"In that case--ah--of course you must come along wi' me,\" says Tony,\nfeeling a dim sort of sweat rising up inside his clothes.  And he reined\nin the horse, and waited till she'd come downstairs, and then helped her\nup beside him.  He drove on again, his face as long as a face that was a\nround one by nature well could be.\n\n'Hannah looked round sideways into his eyes.  \"This is nice, isn't it,\nTony?\" she says.  \"I like riding with you.\"\n\n'Tony looked back into her eyes.  \"And I with you,\" he said after a\nwhile.  In short, having considered her, he warmed up, and the more he\nlooked at her the more he liked her, till he couldn't for the life of him\nthink why he had ever said a word about marriage to Milly or Unity while\nHannah Jolliver was in question.  So they sat a little closer and closer,\ntheir feet upon the foot-board and their shoulders touching, and Tony\nthought over and over again how handsome Hannah was.  He spoke tenderer\nand tenderer, and called her \"dear Hannah\" in a whisper at last.\n\n'\"You've settled it with Milly by this time, I suppose,\" said she.\n\n'\"N-no, not exactly.\"\n\n'\"What?  How low you talk, Tony.\"\n\n'\"Yes--I've a kind of hoarseness.  I said, not exactly.\"\n\n'\"I suppose you mean to?\"\n\n'\"Well, as to that--\"  His eyes rested on her face, and hers on his.  He\nwondered how he could have been such a fool as not to follow up Hannah.\n\"My sweet Hannah!\" he bursts out, taking her hand, not being really able\nto help it, and forgetting Milly and Unity, and all the world besides.\n\"Settled it?  I don't think I have!\"\n\n'\"Hark!\" says Hannah.\n\n'\"What?\" says Tony, letting go her hand.\n\n'\"Surely I heard a sort of little screaming squeak under those sacks?\nWhy, you've been carrying corn, and there's mice in this waggon, I\ndeclare!\"  She began to haul up the tails of her gown.\n\n'\"Oh no; 'tis the axle,\" said Tony in an assuring way.  \"It do go like\nthat sometimes in dry weather.\"\n\n'\"Perhaps it was . . . Well, now, to be quite honest, dear Tony, do you\nlike her better than me?  Because--because, although I've held off so\nindependent, I'll own at last that I do like 'ee, Tony, to tell the\ntruth; and I wouldn't say no if you asked me--you know what.\"\n\n'Tony was so won over by this pretty offering mood of a girl who had been\nquite the reverse (Hannah had a backward way with her at times, if you\ncan mind) that he just glanced behind, and then whispered very soft, \"I\nhaven't quite promised her, and I think I can get out of it, and ask you\nthat question you speak of.\"\n\n'\"Throw over Milly?--all to marry me!  How delightful!\" broke out Hannah,\nquite loud, clapping her hands.\n\n'At this there was a real squeak--an angry, spiteful squeak, and\nafterward a long moan, as if something had broke its heart, and a\nmovement of the empty sacks.\n\n'\"Something's there!\" said Hannah, starting up.\n\n'\"It's nothing, really,\" says Tony in a soothing voice, and praying\ninwardly for a way out of this.  \"I wouldn't tell 'ee at first, because I\nwouldn't frighten 'ee.  But, Hannah, I've really a couple of ferrets in a\nbag under there, for rabbiting, and they quarrel sometimes.  I don't wish\nit knowed, as 'twould be called poaching.  Oh, they can't get out, bless\nye--you are quite safe!  And--and--what a fine day it is, isn't it,\nHannah, for this time of year?  Be you going to market next Saturday?  How\nis your aunt now?\"  And so on, says Tony, to keep her from talking any\nmore about love in Milly's hearing.\n\n'But he found his work cut out for him, and wondering again how he should\nget out of this ticklish business, he looked about for a chance.  Nearing\nhome he saw his father in a field not far off, holding up his hand as if\nhe wished to speak to Tony.\n\n'\"Would you mind taking the reins a moment, Hannah,\" he said, much\nrelieved, \"while I go and find out what father wants?\"\n\n'She consented, and away he hastened into the field, only too glad to get\nbreathing time.  He found that his father was looking at him with rather\na stern eye.\n\n'\"Come, come, Tony,\" says old Mr. Kytes, as soon as his son was alongside\nhim, \"this won't do, you know.\"\n\n'\"What?\" says Tony.\n\n'\"Why, if you mean to marry Milly Richards, do it, and there's an end\no't.  But don't go driving about the country with Jolliver's daughter and\nmaking a scandal.  I won't have such things done.\"\n\n'\"I only asked her--that is, she asked me, to ride home.\"\n\n'\"She?  Why, now, if it had been Milly, 'twould have been quite proper;\nbut you and Hannah Jolliver going about by yourselves--\"\n\n'\"Milly's there too, father.\"\n\n'\"Milly?  Where?\"\n\n'\"Under the corn-sacks!  Yes, the truth is, father, I've got rather into\na nunny-watch, I'm afeard!  Unity Sallet is there too--yes, at the other\nend, under the tarpaulin.  All three are in that waggon, and what to do\nwith 'em I know no more than the dead!  The best plan is, as I'm\nthinking, to speak out loud and plain to one of 'em before the rest, and\nthat will settle it; not but what 'twill cause 'em to kick up a bit of a\nmiff, for certain.  Now which would you marry, father, if you was in my\nplace?\"\n\n'\"Whichever of 'em did _not_ ask to ride with thee.\"\n\n'\"That was Milly, I'm bound to say, as she only mounted by my invitation.\nBut Milly--\"\n\n\"Then stick to Milly, she's the best . . . But look at that!\"\n\n'His father pointed toward the waggon.  \"She can't hold that horse in.\nYou shouldn't have left the reins in her hands.  Run on and take the\nhorse's head, or there'll be some accident to them maids!\"\n\n'Tony's horse, in fact, in spite of Hannah's tugging at the reins, had\nstarted on his way at a brisk walking pace, being very anxious to get\nback to the stable, for he had had a long day out.  Without another word\nTony rushed away from his father to overtake the horse.\n\n'Now of all things that could have happened to wean him from Milly there\nwas nothing so powerful as his father's recommending her.  No; it could\nnot be Milly, after all.  Hannah must be the one, since he could not\nmarry all three.  This he thought while running after the waggon.  But\nqueer things were happening inside it.\n\n'It was, of course, Milly who had screamed under the sack-bags, being\nobliged to let off her bitter rage and shame in that way at what Tony was\nsaying, and never daring to show, for very pride and dread o' being\nlaughed at, that she was in hiding.  She became more and more restless,\nand in twisting herself about, what did she see but another woman's foot\nand white stocking close to her head.  It quite frightened her, not\nknowing that Unity Sallet was in the waggon likewise.  But after the\nfright was over she determined to get to the bottom of all this, and she\ncrept and crept along the bed of the waggon, under the tarpaulin, like a\nsnake, when lo and behold she came face to face with Unity.\n\n'\"Well, if this isn't disgraceful!\" says Milly in a raging whisper to\nUnity.\n\n'\"'Tis,\" says Unity, \"to see you hiding in a young man's waggon like\nthis, and no great character belonging to either of ye!\"\n\n'\"Mind what you are saying!\" replied Milly, getting louder.  \"I am\nengaged to be married to him, and haven't I a right to be here?  What\nright have you, I should like to know?  What has he been promising you?  A\npretty lot of nonsense, I expect!  But what Tony says to other women is\nall mere wind, and no concern to me!\"\n\n'\"Don't you be too sure!\" says Unity.  \"He's going to have Hannah, and\nnot you, nor me either; I could hear that.\"\n\n'Now at these strange voices sounding from under the cloth Hannah was\nthunderstruck a'most into a swound; and it was just at this time that the\nhorse moved on.  Hannah tugged away wildly, not knowing what she was\ndoing; and as the quarrel rose louder and louder Hannah got so horrified\nthat she let go the reins altogether.  The horse went on at his own pace,\nand coming to the corner where we turn round to drop down the hill to\nLower Longpuddle he turned too quick, the off wheels went up the bank,\nthe waggon rose sideways till it was quite on edge upon the near axles,\nand out rolled the three maidens into the road in a heap.\n\n'When Tony came up, frightened and breathless, he was relieved enough to\nsee that neither of his darlings was hurt, beyond a few scratches from\nthe brambles of the hedge.  But he was rather alarmed when he heard how\nthey were going on at one another.\n\n'\"Don't ye quarrel, my dears--don't ye!\" says he, taking off his hat out\nof respect to 'em.  And then he would have kissed them all round, as fair\nand square as a man could, but they were in too much of a taking to let\nhim, and screeched and sobbed till they was quite spent.\n\n'\"Now I'll speak out honest, because I ought to,\" says Tony, as soon as\nhe could get heard.  \"And this is the truth,\" says he.  \"I've asked\nHannah to be mine, and she is willing, and we are going to put up the\nbanns next--\"\n\n'Tony had not noticed that Hannah's father was coming up behind, nor had\nhe noticed that Hannah's face was beginning to bleed from the scratch of\na bramble.  Hannah had seen her father, and had run to him, crying worse\nthan ever.\n\n'\"My daughter is _not_ willing, sir!\" says Mr. Jolliver hot and strong.\n\"Be you willing, Hannah?  I ask ye to have spirit enough to refuse him,\nif yer virtue is left to 'ee and you run no risk?\"\n\n'\"She's as sound as a bell for me, that I'll swear!\" says Tony, flaring\nup.  \"And so's the others, come to that, though you may think it an\nonusual thing in me!\"\n\n'\"I have spirit, and I do refuse him!\" says Hannah, partly because her\nfather was there, and partly, too, in a tantrum because of the discovery,\nand the scratch on her face.  \"Little did I think when I was so soft with\nhim just now that I was talking to such a false deceiver!\"\n\n'\"What, you won't have me, Hannah?\" says Tony, his jaw hanging down like\na dead man's.\n\n'\"Never--I would sooner marry no--nobody at all!\" she gasped out, though\nwith her heart in her throat, for she would not have refused Tony if he\nhad asked her quietly, and her father had not been there, and her face\nhad not been scratched by the bramble.  And having said that, away she\nwalked upon her father's arm, thinking and hoping he would ask her again.\n\n'Tony didn't know what to say next.  Milly was sobbing her heart out; but\nas his father had strongly recommended her he couldn't feel inclined that\nway.  So he turned to Unity.\n\n'\"Well, will you, Unity dear, be mine?\" he says.\n\n'\"Take her leavings?  Not I!\" says Unity.  \"I'd scorn it!\"  And away\nwalks Unity Sallet likewise, though she looked back when she'd gone some\nway, to see if he was following her.\n\n'So there at last were left Milly and Tony by themselves, she crying in\nwatery streams, and Tony looking like a tree struck by lightning.\n\n'\"Well, Milly,\" he says at last, going up to her, \"it do seem as if fate\nhad ordained that it should be you and I, or nobody.  And what must be\nmust be, I suppose.  Hey, Milly?\"\n\n'\"If you like, Tony.  You didn't really mean what you said to them?\"\n\n'\"Not a word of it!\" declares Tony, bringing down his fist upon his palm.\n\n'And then he kissed her, and put the waggon to rights, and they mounted\ntogether; and their banns were put up the very next Sunday.  I was not\nable to go to their wedding, but it was a rare party they had, by all\naccount.  Everybody in Longpuddle was there almost; you among the rest, I\nthink, Mr. Flaxton?'  The speaker turned to the parish clerk.\n\n'I was,' said Mr. Flaxton.  'And that party was the cause of a very\ncurious change in some other people's affairs; I mean in Steve Hardcome's\nand his cousin James's.'\n\n'Ah! the Hardcomes,' said the stranger.  'How familiar that name is to\nme!  What of them?'\n\nThe clerk cleared his throat and began:--\n\n\nTHE HISTORY OF THE HARDCOMES\n\n\n'Yes, Tony's was the very best wedding-randy that ever I was at; and I've\nbeen at a good many, as you may suppose'--turning to the newly-arrived\none--'having as a church-officer, the privilege to attend all\nchristening, wedding, and funeral parties--such being our Wessex custom.\n\n''Twas on a frosty night in Christmas week, and among the folk invited\nwere the said Hardcomes o' Climmerston--Steve and James--first cousins,\nboth of them small farmers, just entering into business on their own\naccount.  With them came, as a matter of course, their intended wives,\ntwo young women of the neighbourhood, both very pretty and sprightly\nmaidens, and numbers of friends from Abbot's-Cernel, and Weatherbury, and\nMellstock, and I don't know where--a regular houseful.\n\n'The kitchen was cleared of furniture for dancing, and the old folk\nplayed at \"Put\" and \"All-fours\" in the parlour, though at last they gave\nthat up to join in the dance.  The top of the figure was by the large\nfront window of the room, and there were so many couples that the lower\npart of the figure reached through the door at the back, and into the\ndarkness of the out-house; in fact, you couldn't see the end of the row\nat all, and 'twas never known exactly how long that dance was, the lowest\ncouples being lost among the faggots and brushwood in the out-house.\n\n'When we had danced a few hours, and the crowns of we taller men were\nswelling into lumps with bumping the beams of the ceiling, the first\nfiddler laid down his fiddle-bow, and said he should play no more, for he\nwished to dance.  And in another hour the second fiddler laid down his,\nand said he wanted to dance too; so there was only the third fiddler\nleft, and he was a' old, veteran man, very weak in the wrist.  However,\nhe managed to keep up a faltering tweedle-dee; but there being no chair\nin the room, and his knees being as weak as his wrists, he was obliged to\nsit upon as much of the little corner-table as projected beyond the\ncorner-cupboard fixed over it, which was not a very wide seat for a man\nadvanced in years.\n\n'Among those who danced most continually were the two engaged couples, as\nwas natural to their situation.  Each pair was very well matched, and\nvery unlike the other.  James Hardcome's intended was called Emily Darth,\nand both she and James were gentle, nice-minded, in-door people, fond of\na quiet life.  Steve and his chosen, named Olive Pawle, were different;\nthey were of a more bustling nature, fond of racketing about and seeing\nwhat was going on in the world.  The two couples had arranged to get\nmarried on the same day, and that not long thence; Tony's wedding being a\nsort of stimulant, as is often the case; I've noticed it professionally\nmany times.\n\n'They danced with such a will as only young people in that stage of\ncourtship can dance; and it happened that as the evening wore on James\nhad for his partner Stephen's plighted one, Olive, at the same time that\nStephen was dancing with James's Emily.  It was noticed that in spite o'\nthe exchange the young men seemed to enjoy the dance no less than before.\nBy and by they were treading another tune in the same changed order as we\nhad noticed earlier, and though at first each one had held the other's\nmistress strictly at half-arm's length, lest there should be shown any\nobjection to too close quarters by the lady's proper man, as time passed\nthere was a little more closeness between 'em; and presently a little\nmore closeness still.\n\n'The later it got the more did each of the two cousins dance with the\nwrong young girl, and the tighter did he hold her to his side as he\nwhirled her round; and, what was very remarkable, neither seemed to mind\nwhat the other was doing.  The party began to draw towards its end, and I\nsaw no more that night, being one of the first to leave, on account of my\nmorning's business.  But I learnt the rest of it from those that knew.\n\n'After finishing a particularly warming dance with the changed partners,\nas I've mentioned, the two young men looked at one another, and in a\nmoment or two went out into the porch together.\n\n'\"James,\" says Steve, \"what were you thinking of when you were dancing\nwith my Olive?\"\n\n'\"Well,\" said James, \"perhaps what you were thinking of when you were\ndancing with my Emily.\"\n\n'\"I was thinking,\" said Steve, with some hesitation, \"that I wouldn't\nmind changing for good and all!\"\n\n'\"It was what I was feeling likewise,\" said James.\n\n'\"I willingly agree to it, if you think we could manage it.\"\n\n'\"So do I.  But what would the girls say?\"\n\n'\"'Tis my belief,\" said Steve, \"that they wouldn't particularly object.\nYour Emily clung as close to me as if she already belonged to me, dear\ngirl.\"\n\n'\"And your Olive to me,\" says James.  \"I could feel her heart beating\nlike a clock.\"\n\n'Well, they agreed to put it to the girls when they were all four walking\nhome together.  And they did so.  When they parted that night the\nexchange was decided on--all having been done under the hot excitement of\nthat evening's dancing.  Thus it happened that on the following Sunday\nmorning, when the people were sitting in church with mouths wide open to\nhear the names published as they had expected, there was no small\namazement to hear them coupled the wrong way, as it seemed.  The\ncongregation whispered, and thought the parson had made a mistake; till\nthey discovered that his reading of the names was verily the true way.  As\nthey had decided, so they were married, each one to the other's original\nproperty.\n\n'Well, the two couples lived on for a year or two ordinarily enough, till\nthe time came when these young people began to grow a little less warm to\ntheir respective spouses, as is the rule of married life; and the two\ncousins wondered more and more in their hearts what had made 'em so mad\nat the last moment to marry crosswise as they did, when they might have\nmarried straight, as was planned by nature, and as they had fallen in\nlove.  'Twas Tony's party that had done _it_, plain enough, and they half\nwished they had never gone there.  James, being a quiet, fireside,\nperusing man, felt at times a wide gap between himself and Olive, his\nwife, who loved riding and driving and out-door jaunts to a degree;\nwhile Steve, who was always knocking about hither and thither, had a very\ndomestic wife, who worked samplers, and made hearthrugs, scarcely ever\nwished to cross the threshold, and only drove out with him to please him.\n\n'However, they said very little about this mismating to any of their\nacquaintances, though sometimes Steve would look at James's wife and\nsigh, and James would look at Steve's wife and do the same.  Indeed, at\nlast the two men were frank enough towards each other not to mind\nmentioning it quietly to themselves, in a long-faced, sorry-smiling,\nwhimsical sort of way, and would shake their heads together over their\nfoolishness in upsetting a well-considered choice on the strength of an\nhour's fancy in the whirl and wildness of a dance.  Still, they were\nsensible and honest young fellows enough, and did their best to make\nshift with their lot as they had arranged it, and not to repine at what\ncould not now be altered or mended.\n\n'So things remained till one fine summer day they went for their yearly\nlittle outing together, as they had made it their custom to do for a long\nwhile past.  This year they chose Budmouth-Regis as the place to spend\ntheir holiday in; and off they went in their best clothes at nine o'clock\nin the morning.\n\n'When they had reached Budmouth-Regis they walked two and two along the\nshore--their new boots going squeakity-squash upon the clammy velvet\nsands.  I can seem to see 'em now!  Then they looked at the ships in the\nharbour; and then went up to the Look-out; and then had dinner at an inn;\nand then again walked two and two, squeakity-squash, upon the velvet\nsands.  As evening drew on they sat on one of the public seats upon the\nEsplanade, and listened to the band; and then they said \"What shall we do\nnext?\"\n\n'\"Of all things,\" said Olive (Mrs. James Hardcome, that is), \"I should\nlike to row in the bay!  We could listen to the music from the water as\nwell as from here, and have the fun of rowing besides.\"\n\n'\"The very thing; so should I,\" says Stephen, his tastes being always\nlike hers.\n\nHere the clerk turned to the curate.\n\n'But you, sir, know the rest of the strange particulars of that strange\nevening of their lives better than anybody else, having had much of it\nfrom their own lips, which I had not; and perhaps you'll oblige the\ngentleman?'\n\n'Certainly, if it is wished,' said the curate.  And he took up the\nclerk's tale:--\n\n* * * * *\n\n'Stephen's wife hated the sea, except from land, and couldn't bear the\nthought of going into a boat.  James, too, disliked the water, and said\nthat for his part he would much sooner stay on and listen to the band in\nthe seat they occupied, though he did not wish to stand in his wife's way\nif she desired a row.  The end of the discussion was that James and his\ncousin's wife Emily agreed to remain where they were sitting and enjoy\nthe music, while they watched the other two hire a boat just beneath, and\ntake their water-excursion of half an hour or so, till they should choose\nto come back and join the sitters on the Esplanade; when they would all\nstart homeward together.\n\n'Nothing could have pleased the other two restless ones better than this\narrangement; and Emily and James watched them go down to the boatman\nbelow and choose one of the little yellow skiffs, and walk carefully out\nupon the little plank that was laid on trestles to enable them to get\nalongside the craft.  They saw Stephen hand Olive in, and take his seat\nfacing her; when they were settled they waved their hands to the couple\nwatching them, and then Stephen took the pair of sculls and pulled off to\nthe tune beat by the band, she steering through the other boats skimming\nabout, for the sea was as smooth as glass that evening, and\npleasure-seekers were rowing everywhere.\n\n'\"How pretty they look moving on, don't they?\" said Emily to James (as\nI've been assured).  \"They both enjoy it equally.  In everything their\nlikings are the same.\"\n\n'\"That's true,\" said James.\n\n'\"They would have made a handsome pair if they had married,\" said she.\n\n'\"Yes,\" said he.  \"'Tis a pity we should have parted 'em\"\n\n'\"Don't talk of that, James,\" said she.  \"For better or for worse we\ndecided to do as we did, and there's an end of it.\"\n\n'They sat on after that without speaking, side by side, and the band\nplayed as before; the people strolled up and down; and Stephen and Olive\nshrank smaller and smaller as they shot straight out to sea.  The two on\nshore used to relate how they saw Stephen stop rowing a moment, and take\noff his coat to get at his work better; but James's wife sat quite still\nin the stern, holding the tiller-ropes by which she steered the boat.\nWhen they had got very small indeed she turned her head to shore.\n\n'\"She is waving her handkerchief to us,\" said Stephen's wife, who\nthereupon pulled out her own, and waved it as a return signal.\n\n'The boat's course had been a little awry while Mrs. James neglected her\nsteering to wave her handkerchief to her husband and Mrs. Stephen; but\nnow the light skiff went straight onward again, and they could soon see\nnothing more of the two figures it contained than Olive's light mantle\nand Stephen's white shirt sleeves behind.\n\n'The two on the shore talked on.  \"'Twas very curious--our changing\npartners at Tony Kytes's wedding,\" Emily declared.  \"Tony was of a fickle\nnature by all account, and it really seemed as if his character had\ninfected us that night.  Which of you two was it that first proposed not\nto marry as we were engaged?\"\n\n'\"H'm--I can't remember at this moment,\" says James.  \"We talked it over,\nyou know; and no sooner said than done.\"\n\n'\"'Twas the dancing,\" said she.  \"People get quite crazy sometimes in a\ndance.\"\n\n'\"They do,\" he owned.\n\n'\"James--do you think they care for one another still?\" asks Mrs.\nStephen.\n\n'James Hardcome mused and admitted that perhaps a little tender feeling\nmight flicker up in their hearts for a moment now and then.  \"Still,\nnothing of any account,\" he said.\n\n'\"I sometimes think that Olive is in Steve's mind a good deal,\" murmurs\nMrs. Stephen; \"particularly when she pleases his fancy by riding past our\nwindow at a gallop on one of the draught-horses . . . I never could do\nanything of that sort; I could never get over my fear of a horse.\"\n\n'\"And I am no horseman, though I pretend to be on her account,\" murmured\nJames Hardcome.  \"But isn't it almost time for them to turn and sweep\nround to the shore, as the other boating folk have done?  I wonder what\nOlive means by steering away straight to the horizon like that?  She has\nhardly swerved from a direct line seaward since they started.\"\n\n'\"No doubt they are talking, and don't think of where they are going,\"\nsuggests Stephen's wife.\n\n'\"Perhaps so,\" said James.  \"I didn't know Steve could row like that.\"\n\n'\"O yes,\" says she.  \"He often comes here on business, and generally has\na pull round the bay.\"\n\n'\"I can hardly see the boat or them,\" says James again; \"and it is\ngetting dark.\"\n\n'The heedless pair afloat now formed a mere speck in the films of the\ncoming night, which thickened apace, till it completely swallowed up\ntheir distant shapes.  They had disappeared while still following the\nsame straight course away from the world of land-livers, as if they were\nintending to drop over the sea-edge into space, and never return to earth\nagain.\n\n'The two on the shore continued to sit on, punctually abiding by their\nagreement to remain on the same spot till the others returned.  The\nEsplanade lamps were lit one by one, the bandsmen folded up their stands\nand departed, the yachts in the bay hung out their riding lights, and the\nlittle boats came back to shore one after another, their hirers walking\non to the sands by the plank they had climbed to go afloat; but among\nthese Stephen and Olive did not appear.\n\n'\"What a time they are!\" said Emily.  \"I am getting quite chilly.  I did\nnot expect to have to sit so long in the evening air.\"\n\n'Thereupon James Hardcome said that he did not require his overcoat, and\ninsisted on lending it to her.\n\n'He wrapped it round Emily's shoulders.\n\n'\"Thank you, James,\" she said.  \"How cold Olive must be in that thin\njacket!\"\n\n'He said he was thinking so too.  \"Well, they are sure to be quite close\nat hand by this time, though we can't see 'em.  The boats are not all in\nyet.  Some of the rowers are fond of paddling along the shore to finish\nout their hour of hiring.\"\n\n'\"Shall we walk by the edge of the water,\" said she, \"to see if we can\ndiscover them?\"\n\n'He assented, reminding her that they must not lose sight of the seat,\nlest the belated pair should return and miss them, and be vexed that they\nhad not kept the appointment.\n\n'They walked a sentry beat up and down the sands immediately opposite the\nseat; and still the others did not come.  James Hardcome at last went to\nthe boatman, thinking that after all his wife and cousin might have come\nin under shadow of the dusk without being perceived, and might have\nforgotten the appointment at the bench.\n\n'\"All in?\" asked James.\n\n'\"All but one boat,\" said the lessor.  \"I can't think where that couple\nis keeping to.  They might run foul of something or other in the dark.\"\n\n'Again Stephen's wife and Olive's husband waited, with more and more\nanxiety.  But no little yellow boat returned.  Was it possible they could\nhave landed further down the Esplanade?\n\n'\"It may have been done to escape paying,\" said the boat-owner.  \"But\nthey didn't look like people who would do that.\"\n\n'James Hardcome knew that he could found no hope on such a reason as\nthat.  But now, remembering what had been casually discussed between\nSteve and himself about their wives from time to time, he admitted for\nthe first time the possibility that their old tenderness had been revived\nby their face-to-face position more strongly than either had anticipated\nat starting--the excursion having been so obviously undertaken for the\npleasure of the performance only,--and that they had landed at some steps\nhe knew of further down toward the pier, to be longer alone together.\n\n'Still he disliked to harbour the thought, and would not mention its\nexistence to his companion.  He merely said to her, \"Let us walk further\non.\"\n\n'They did so, and lingered between the boat-stage and the pier till\nStephen Hardcome's wife was uneasy, and was obliged to accept James's\noffered arm.  Thus the night advanced.  Emily was presently so worn out\nby fatigue that James felt it necessary to conduct her home; there was,\ntoo, a remote chance that the truants had landed in the harbour on the\nother side of the town, or elsewhere, and hastened home in some\nunexpected way, in the belief that their consorts would not have waited\nso long.\n\n'However, he left a direction in the town that a lookout should be kept,\nthough this was arranged privately, the bare possibility of an elopement\nbeing enough to make him reticent; and, full of misgivings, the two\nremaining ones hastened to catch the last train out of Budmouth-Regis;\nand when they got to Casterbridge drove back to Upper Longpuddle.'\n\n'Along this very road as we do now,' remarked the parish clerk.\n\n'To be sure--along this very road,' said the curate.  'However, Stephen\nand Olive were not at their homes; neither had entered the village since\nleaving it in the morning.  Emily and James Hardcome went to their\nrespective dwellings to snatch a hasty night's rest, and at daylight the\nnext morning they drove again to Casterbridge and entered the Budmouth\ntrain, the line being just opened.\n\n'Nothing had been heard of the couple there during this brief absence.  In\nthe course of a few hours some young men testified to having seen such a\nman and woman rowing in a frail hired craft, the head of the boat kept\nstraight to sea; they had sat looking in each other's faces as if they\nwere in a dream, with no consciousness of what they were doing, or\nwhither they were steering.  It was not till late that day that more\ntidings reached James's ears.  The boat had been found drifting bottom\nupward a long way from land.  In the evening the sea rose somewhat, and a\ncry spread through the town that two bodies were cast ashore in Lullstead\nBay, several miles to the eastward.  They were brought to Budmouth, and\ninspection revealed them to be the missing pair.  It was said that they\nhad been found tightly locked in each other's arms, his lips upon hers,\ntheir features still wrapt in the same calm and dream-like repose which\nhad been observed in their demeanour as they had glided along.\n\n'Neither James nor Emily questioned the original motives of the\nunfortunate man and woman in putting to sea.  They were both above\nsuspicion as to intention.  Whatever their mutual feelings might have led\nthem on to, underhand behaviour was foreign to the nature of either.\nConjecture pictured that they might have fallen into tender reverie while\ngazing each into a pair of eyes that had formerly flashed for him and her\nalone, and, unwilling to avow what their mutual sentiments were, they had\ncontinued thus, oblivious of time and space, till darkness suddenly\novertook them far from land.  But nothing was truly known.  It had been\ntheir destiny to die thus.  The two halves, intended by Nature to make\nthe perfect whole, had failed in that result during their lives, though\n\"in their death they were not divided.\"  Their bodies were brought home,\nand buried on one day.  I remember that, on looking round the churchyard\nwhile reading the service, I observed nearly all the parish at their\nfuneral.'\n\n'It was so, sir,' said the clerk.\n\n'The remaining two,' continued the curate (whose voice had grown husky\nwhile relating the lovers' sad fate), 'were a more thoughtful and far-\nseeing, though less romantic, couple than the first.  They were now\nmutually bereft of a companion, and found themselves by this accident in\na position to fulfil their destiny according to Nature's plan and their\nown original and calmly-formed intention.  James Hardcome took Emily to\nwife in the course of a year and a half; and the marriage proved in every\nrespect a happy one.  I solemnized the service, Hardcome having told me,\nwhen he came to give notice of the proposed wedding, the story of his\nfirst wife's loss almost word for word as I have told it to you.'\n\n'And are they living in Longpuddle still?' asked the new-comer.\n\n'O no, sir,' interposed the clerk.  'James has been dead these dozen\nyears, and his mis'ess about six or seven.  They had no children.  William\nPrivett used to be their odd man till he died.'\n\n'Ah--William Privett!  He dead too?--dear me!' said the other.  'All\npassed away!'\n\n'Yes, sir.  William was much older than I.  He'd ha' been over eighty if\nhe had lived till now.'\n\n'There was something very strange about William's death--very strange\nindeed!' sighed a melancholy man in the back of the van.  It was the\nseedsman's father, who had hitherto kept silence.\n\n'And what might that have been?' asked Mr. Lackland.\n\n","Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?\nI will have one.\nOkay, I’m not gonna have one.\nNeither will I.\nNo, no, it’s just my tooth.\nAll right I’ll have one.\nSo what’s a matter, you need a dentist?

In that time, our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined. We faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens. These issues call for vigorous debate, and I think it's fair to say we've answered the call. Yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose. And together, we showed the world the power and resilience of American self-government.\n\nAll of us were sent to Washington to carry out the people's business. That is the purpose of this body. It is the meaning of our oath. It remains our charge to keep.\n\nThe actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity of our nation long after this session has ended. In this election year, let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them. Let us show them that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time.\n\nFrom expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we've made good progress. Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American people expect us to get it done.\n\nIn the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our nation great. As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history. We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens. And so in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions, and empower them to improve their lives for their futures.\n\nTo build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy. As we meet tonight, our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty. America has added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace. Wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas. Exports are rising, but the housing market has declined. At kitchen tables across our country, there is a concern about our economic future.\n\nIn the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth. But in the short run, we can all see that that growth is slowing. So last week, my administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment. The temptation will be to load up the bill. That would delay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable. This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working. And this Congress must pass it as soon as possible.\n\nWe have other work to do on taxes. Unless Congress acts, most of the tax relief we've delivered over the past seven years will be taken away. Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase. Try explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800. Others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes. I welcome their enthusiasm. I'm pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks and money orders.\n\nMost Americans think their taxes are high enough. With all the other pressures on their finances, American families should not have to worry about their federal government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks. There's only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: Make the tax relief permanent. And members of Congress should know: If any bill raises taxes reaches my desk, I will veto it.\n\nJust as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely. Next week, I'll send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs, totaling more than $18 billion. The budget that I will submit will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012. American families have to balance their budgets; so should their government.\n\nThe people's trust in their government is undermined by congressional earmarks — special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I'll send it back to you with my veto.\n\nAnd tomorrow, I will issue an executive order that directs federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by Congress. If these items are truly worth funding, Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote.\n\nOur shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending. On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market. My administration brought together the HOPE NOW alliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. And Congress can help even more. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and allow state housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. These are difficult times for many American families, and by taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes.\n\nTo build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options. We share a common goal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans. The best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not government control. So I have proposed ending the bias in the tax code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer. This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this year.\n\nThe Congress must also expand health savings accounts, create Association Health Plans for small businesses, promote health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits. With all these steps, we will help ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor's office — not in the halls of Congress.\n\nOn education, we must trust students to learn if given the chance, and empower parents to demand results from our schools. In neighborhoods across our country, there are boys and girls with dreams — and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them.\n\nSix years ago, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today no one can deny its results. Last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record. Reading scores are on the rise. African American and Hispanic students posted all-time highs. Now we must work together to increase accountability, add flexibility for states and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, provide extra help for struggling schools.\n\nMembers of Congress: The No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement. It is succeeding. And we owe it to America's children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law.\n\nWe must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up. Thanks to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our Nation's Capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other non-public school. Sadly, these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of America's inner cities. So I will convene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning. And to open the doors of these schools to more children, I ask you to support a new $300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids. We have seen how Pell Grants help low-income college students realize their full potential. Together, we've expanded the size and reach of these grants. Now let us apply that same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools.\n\nOn trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas. Today, our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods and crops and services all over the world. So we're working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can. We're working for a successful Doha Round of trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year. At the same time, we're pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements.\n\nI thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru. And now I ask you to approve agreements with Colombia and Panama and South Korea. Many products from these nations now enter America duty-free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets. These agreements will level the playing field. They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers. They will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world: those whose products say \"Made in the USA.\"\n\nThese agreements also promote America's strategic interests. The first agreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror, and fighting drug traffickers. If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere. So we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life.\n\nTrade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices. Yet for some Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the federal government has a responsibility to help. I ask Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance, so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs.\n\nTo build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology. Our security, our prosperity, and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil. Last year, I asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and you responded. Together we should take the next steps: Let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions. Let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear power. Let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future. Let us create a new international clean technology fund, which will help developing nations like India and China make greater use of clean energy sources. And let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases.\n\nThis agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride. The United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change. And the best way to meet these goals is for America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy-efficient technology.\n\nTo keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow. Last year, Congress passed legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never followed through with the funding. This funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge. So I ask Congress to double federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on Earth.\n\nOn matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries. In November, we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life.\n\nSo we're expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research. And as we explore promising avenues of research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves. And so I call on Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life.\n\nOn matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our founders and empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says. I've submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel. Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed. They are worthy of confirmation, and the Senate should give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote.\n\nIn communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the American people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need. Over the past seven years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service. Americans have volunteered in record numbers. Charitable donations are higher than ever. Faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from the federal government. And to help guarantee equal treatment of faith-based organizations when they compete for federal funds, I ask you to permanently extend Charitable Choice.\n\nTonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the Gulf Coast. America honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region. We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before. And tonight I'm pleased to announce that in April we will host this year's North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and the United States in the great city of New Orleans.\n\nThere are two other pressing challenges that I've raised repeatedly before this body, and that this body has failed to address: entitlement spending and immigration. Every member in this chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford. We all know the painful choices ahead if America stays on this path: massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling deficits. I've laid out proposals to reform these programs. Now I ask members of Congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nThe other pressing challenge is immigration. America needs to secure our borders — and with your help, my administration is taking steps to do so. We're increasing worksite enforcement, deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings. We've effectively ended the policy of \"catch and release\" at the border, and by the end of this year, we will have doubled the number of border patrol agents. Yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy. This will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm. We must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally. Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be resolved. And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals.\n\nThis is the business of our nation here at home. Yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world.\n\nOur foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people, when given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace. In the last seven years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty. We've seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections. We've seen people in Lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence. We've seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban and choose a new president and a new parliament. We've seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink-stained fingers and celebrating their freedom. These images of liberty have inspired us.\n\nIn the past seven years, we've also seen images that have sobered us. We've watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin's hand. We've seen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in Jordan, Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs. On a clear September day, we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant. These horrific images serve as a grim reminder: The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists — evil men who despise freedom, despise America, and aim to subject millions to their violent rule.\n\nSince 9/11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists. We will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, and we will deliver justice to our enemies.\n\nWe are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century. The terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear. Yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and our enemies agree on: In the long run, men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny. And that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Territories. And that is why, for the security of America and the peace of the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom.\n\nIn Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations are helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country. Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for al Qaeda is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with new hope. These successes must continue, so we're adding 3,200 Marines to our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and train the Afghan Army and police. Defeating the Taliban and al Qaeda is critical to our security, and I thank the Congress for supporting America's vital mission in Afghanistan.\n\nIn Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty, and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world. One year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos. So we reviewed our strategy and changed course. We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq. We gave our troops a new mission: Work with the Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country.\n\nThe Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened. Those who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into their country. They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return. And they saw our troops, along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams that include Foreign Service officers and other skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life. Our military and civilians in Iraq are performing with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our whole nation.\n\nThe Iraqis launched a surge of their own. In the fall of 2006, Sunni tribal leaders grew tired of al Qaeda's brutality and started a popular uprising called \"The Anbar Awakening.\" Over the past year, similar movements have spread across the country. And today, the grassroots surge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists. The government in Baghdad has stepped forward, as well — adding more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year.\n\nWhile the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American and Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year ago. When we met last year, many said that containing the violence was impossible. A year later, high profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down.\n\nWhen we met last year, militia extremists — some armed and trained by Iran — were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq. A year later, coalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters. And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country.\n\nWhen we met last year, al Qaeda had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country. Today, it is al Qaeda that is searching for safe passage. They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held, and over the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key al Qaeda leaders and operatives.\n\nLast month, Osama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on al Qaeda and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq. Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt. Al Qaeda is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated.\n\nWhen we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise. Today, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of \"return on success,\" and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning to come home.\n\nThis progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders. This evening, I want to speak directly to our men and women on the front lines. Soldiers and sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen: In the past year, you have done everything we've asked of you, and more. Our nation is grateful for your courage. We are proud of your accomplishments. And tonight in this hallowed chamber, with the American people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need to protect our nation. And I ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops.\n\nOur enemies in Iraq have been hit hard. They are not yet defeated, and we can still expect tough fighting ahead. Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007, while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy. American troops are shifting from leading operations, to partnering with Iraqi forces, and, eventually, to a protective overwatch mission. As part of this transition, one Army brigade combat team and one Marine Expeditionary Unit have already come home and will not be replaced. In the coming months, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit. Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home.\n\nAny further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and the recommendations of our commanders. General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in the \"disintegration of the Iraqi security forces, al Qaeda-Iraq regaining lost ground, [and] a marked increase in violence.\" Members of Congress: Having come so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen.\n\nIn the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they're making toward political reconciliation. At the local level, Sunnis, Shia, and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives. Progress in the provinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad. We're seeing some encouraging signs. The national government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces. The parliament recently passed both a pension law and de-Baathification reform. They're now debating a provincial powers law. The Iraqis still have a distance to travel. But after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place — and the Iraqi people are taking control of their future.\n\nThe mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our nation. But it is in the vital interest of the United States that we succeed. A free Iraq will deny al Qaeda a safe haven. A free Iraq will show millions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible. A free Iraq will be a friend of America, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world.\n\nBy contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden the extremists, strengthen Iran, and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, our allies, and our homeland. The enemy has made its intentions clear. At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, al Qaida's top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in Washington. My fellow Americans: We will not rest either. We will not rest until this enemy has been defeated. We must do the difficult work today, so that years from now people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer America.\n\nWe're also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land, where we have new cause for hope. Palestinians have elected a president who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel. Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state will be a source of lasting security. This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from both sides that America will do, and I will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this year. The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side-by-side in peace.\n\nWe're also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in Tehran. Iran's rulers oppress a good and talented people. And wherever freedom advances in the Middle East, it seems the Iranian regime is there to oppose it. Iran is funding and training militia groups in Iraq, supporting Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon, and backing Hamas' efforts to undermine peace in the Holy Land. Tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range, and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used to create a nuclear weapon.\n\nOur message to the people of Iran is clear: We have no quarrel with you. We respect your traditions and your history. We look forward to the day when you have your freedom. Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment, so negotiations can begin. And to rejoin the community of nations, come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, cease your support for terror abroad. But above all, know this: America will confront those who threaten our troops. We will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf.\n\nOn the home front, we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country. This is our most solemn duty. We are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 9/11. This is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy. In the past six years, we've stopped numerous attacks, including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for America over the Atlantic. Dedicated men and women in our government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans. These good citizens are saving American lives, and everyone in this chamber owes them our thanks.\n\nAnd we owe them something more: We owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe. And one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications. To protect America, we need to know who the terrorists are talking to, what they are saying, and what they're planning. Last year, Congress passed legislation to help us do that. Unfortunately, Congress set the legislation to expire on February the 1st. That means if you don't act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger. Congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted. Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America. We've had ample time for debate. The time to act is now.\n\nProtecting our nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military. It also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair. So America is using its influence to build a freer, more hopeful, and more compassionate world. This is a reflection of our national interest; it is the calling of our conscience.\n\nAmerica opposes genocide in Sudan. We support freedom in countries from Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma.\n\nAmerica is leading the fight against global poverty, with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance. We've also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account. This program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law in developing nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative.\n\nAmerica is leading the fight against global hunger. Today, more than half the world's food aid comes from the United States. And tonight, I ask Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world, so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine.\n\nAmerica is leading the fight against disease. With your help, we're working to cut by half the number of malaria-related deaths in 15 African nations. And our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4 million people. We can bring healing and hope to many more. So I ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success. And I call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS by approving an additional $30 billion over the next five years.\n\nAmerica is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people, and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us. We must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace. Over the past seven years, we've increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent. And as we increase funding — And as increase funding we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation. I call on the Congress to enact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala, so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity.\n\nOur military families also sacrifice for America. They endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home. We have a responsibility to provide for them. So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the federal government, and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children. Our military families serve our nation, they inspire our nation, and tonight our nation honors them.\n\nThe strength — the secret of our strength, the miracle of America, is that our greatness lies not in our government, but in the spirit and determination of our people. When the Federal Convention met in Philadelphia in 1787, our nation was bound by the Articles of Confederation, which began with the words, \"We the undersigned delegates.\" When Gouverneur Morris was asked to draft a preamble to our new Constitution, he offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of our nation and the history of the world: \"We the people.\"\n\nBy trusting the people, our Founders wagered that a great and noble nation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women. By trusting the people, succeeding generations transformed our fragile young democracy into the most powerful nation on Earth and a beacon of hope for millions. And so long as we continue to trust the people, our nation will prosper, our liberty will be secure, and the state of our Union will remain strong.\n\nSo tonight, with confidence in freedom's power, and trust in the people, let us set forth to do their business. God bless America.\n","Is there anybody going to listen to my story\nAll about the girl who came to stay?\nShe's the kind of girl you want so much\nIt makes you sorry;\nStill, you don't regret a single day.\nAh girl!

The windstorm is often referred to as a twister, whirlwind or cyclone, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology to name a weather system with a low-pressure area in the center around which, from an observer looking down toward the surface of the earth, winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, and they are often visible in the form of a condensation funnel originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, with a cloud of rotating debris and dust beneath it. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 mph, are about 250 ft across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph, are more than 2 mi in diameter, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km).\n\nVarious types of tornadoes include the multiple vortex tornado, landspout, and waterspout. Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirl, and steam devil.\n\nTornadoes occur most frequently in North America, particularly in central and southeastern regions of the United States colloquially known as tornado alley, as well as in Southern Africa, northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh and adjacent eastern India, and southeastern South America. Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as hook echoes or debris balls, as well as through the efforts of storm spotters.\n\nThere are several scales for rating the strength of tornadoes. The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale. An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (trochoidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word tornado comes from the Spanish word tornado (past participle of to turn, or to have torn). Tornadoes' opposite phenomena are the derechoes (, from derecho, \"straight\"). A tornado is also commonly referred to as a \"twister\", and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term cyclone. The term \"cyclone\" is used as a synonym for \"tornado\" in the often-aired 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. The term \"twister\" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 tornado-related film Twister.\n\nA tornado is \"a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud\". For a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. Tornado refers to the vortex of wind, not the condensation cloud.\n\nA tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor in the air to condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.\n\nThere is some disagreement over the definition of a funnel cloud and a condensation funnel. According to the Glossary of Meteorology, a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud.\n\nTornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, and not all funnel clouds evolve into tornadoes. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance.\n\nOccasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm cell are referred to as a \"tornado family\". Several tornadoes are sometimes spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a tornado outbreak (although the term \"tornado outbreak\" has various definitions). A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a tornado outbreak sequence, occasionally called an extended tornado outbreak.\n\n\n\nMost tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow funnel, a few hundred yards (meters) across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground. Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. Tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.\n\nSmall, relatively weak landspouts may be visible only as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph, the circulation is considered a tornado. A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a \"stovepipe\" tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large wedges stuck into the ground, and so are known as \"wedge tornadoes\" or \"wedges\". The \"stovepipe\" classification is also used for this type of tornado if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges.\n\nTornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be \"roping out\", or becoming a \"rope tornado\". When they rope out, the length of their funnel increases, which forces the winds within the funnel to weaken due to conservation of angular momentum. Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or they may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel.\n\nIn the United States, tornadoes are around 500 ft across on average and travel on the ground for 5 mi. However, there is a wide range of tornado sizes. Weak tornadoes, or strong yet dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet or couple meters across. One tornado was reported to have a damage path only 7 ft long. On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska on May 22, 2004, was up to 2.5 mi wide at the ground, and a tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma on May 31, 2013 was approximately 2.6 mi wide, the widest on record.\n\nIn terms of path length, the Tri-State Tornado, which affected parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925, was on the ground continuously for 219 mi. Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 mi or longer are composed of a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado may have begun 15 mi further west than previously thought.\n\nTornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.\n\n\n\nLighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is \"back-lit\" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink.\n\nDust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.\n\nThere is mounting evidence, including Doppler on Wheels mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the eye of tropical cyclones. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado.\n\nTornadoes normally rotate cyclonically (when viewed from above, this is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the Coriolis effect, thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is unimportant, as indicated by their large Rossby numbers. Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. Low-level mesocyclones and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment.\n\nApproximately 1 percent of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction in the northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.\n\nTornadoes emit widely on the acoustics spectrum and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby jet engine, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature of and the propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.\n\nThe winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent turbulent eddies, as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable bees or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of \"noise\".\n\nSince many tornadoes are audible only when very near, sound is not to be thought of as a reliable warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.\n\nTornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible infrasonic signatures.\n\nUnlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. Tornadoes also produce a detectable seismic signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process.\n\nTornadoes emit on the electromagnetic spectrum, with sferics and E-field effects detected. There are observed correlations between tornadoes and patterns of lightning. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. Electromagnetics and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a thermodynamic phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.\n\nLuminosity has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and power flashes from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded. In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as temperature, moisture, and pressure. For example, on June 24, 2003 near Manchester, South Dakota, a probe measured a 100 mbar (hPa) (2.95 inHg) pressure decrease. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850 mbar (hPa) (25.10 inHg) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado.\n\n\n\nTornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as supercells. Supercells contain mesocyclones, an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 1 – across. Most intense tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.\n\nMost tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.\n\nAs the mesocyclone lowers below the cloud base, it begins to take in cool, moist air from the downdraft region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an area of low pressure at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, in the form of a visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.\n\nInitially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist air flowing inward to power it, and it grows until it reaches the \"mature stage\". This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. The low pressured atmosphere at the base of the tornado is essential to the endurance of the system. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado.\n\nAs the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the \"dissipating stage\", often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado ends. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. Even though the tornado is dissipating, it is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, due to conservation of angular momentum, winds can increase at this point.\n\nAs the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. Sometimes, in intense supercells, tornadoes can develop cyclically. As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm and possibly feed a new mesocyclone. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old (occluded) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.\n\nAlthough this is a widely accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.\n\n\n\n\n\nA multiple-vortex tornado is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate about their own axis and at the same time around a common center. A multi-vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. This is a phenomenon that is distinct from a satellite tornado, which is a smaller tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to \"orbit\" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct circulation, and is much smaller than the main funnel.\n\n\n\nA waterspout is defined by the National Weather Service as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish \"fair weather\" waterspouts from tornadic (i.e. associated with a mesocyclone) waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar to dust devils and landspouts. They form at the bases of cumulus congestus clouds over tropical and subtropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth laminar walls, and typically travel very slowly. They occur most commonly in the Florida Keys and in the northern Adriatic Sea. In contrast, tornadic waterspouts are stronger tornadoes over water. They form over water similarly to mesocyclonic tornadoes, or are stronger tornadoes which cross over water. Since they form from severe thunderstorms and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are more dangerous. In official tornado statistics, waterspouts are generally not counted unless they affect land, though some European weather agencies count waterspouts and tornadoes together.\n\nA landspout, or dust-tube tornado, is a tornado not associated with a mesocyclone. The name stems from their characterization as a \"fair weather waterspout on land\". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the surface. Landspouts also create a distinctively laminar cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they can produce strong winds which could cause serious damage.\n\n\n\nA gustnado, or gust front tornado, is a small, vertical swirl associated with a gust front or downburst. Because they are not connected with a cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a thunderstorm is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a \"rolling\" effect (often exemplified through a roll cloud). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned vertically or diagonally and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage.\n\n\n\nA dust devil (also known as a whirlwind) resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.\n\nSmall-scale, tornado-like circulations can occur near any intense surface heat source. Those that occur near intense wildfires are called fire whirls. They are not considered tornadoes, except in the rare case where they connect to a pyrocumulus or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage.\n\nA steam devil is a rotating updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations do not involve high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.\n\nThe Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale was an update to the older Fujita scale, by expert elicitation, using engineered wind estimates and better damage descriptions. The EF Scale was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating, and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler weather radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.\n\n\n\nTornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from subvortices.\n\nIn the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strength—less than 1% are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger). Outside Tornado Alley, and North America in general, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe United States has the most tornadoes of any country, nearly four times more than estimated in all of Europe, excluding waterspouts. This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a large continent that extends from the tropics north into arctic areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the middle latitudes, where most tornadoes of the world occur, the Rocky Mountains block moisture and buckle the atmospheric flow, forcing drier air at mid-levels of the troposphere due to downsloped winds, and causing the formation of a low pressure area downwind to the east of the mountains. Increased westerly flow off the Rockies force the formation of a dry line when the flow aloft is strong, while the Gulf of Mexico fuels abundant low-level moisture in the southerly flow to its east. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States known as Tornado Alley. This area extends into Canada, particularly Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, although southeast Quebec, the interior of British Columbia, and western New Brunswick are also tornado-prone. Tornadoes also occur across northeastern Mexico.\n\nThe United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year, followed by Canada, averaging 62 reported per year. NOAA's has a higher average 100 per year in Canada. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km 2 ), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km 2 ), per year), although those are of lower intensity, briefer and cause minor damage.\n\nTornadoes kill an average of 179 people per year in Bangladesh, the most in the world. Reasons for this include the region's high population density, poor construction quality, and lack of tornado safety knowledge. Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, the La Plata Basin area, portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia.\n\nTornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter, but tornadoes can occur any time of year that favorable conditions occur. Spring and fall experience peaks of activity as those are the seasons when stronger winds, wind shear, and atmospheric instability are present. Tornadoes are focused in the right front quadrant of landfalling tropical cyclones, which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices, which persist until landfall.\n\nTornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of solar heating. Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. Destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The Gainesville Tornado of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time.\n\nThe United Kingdom has the highest incidence of tornadoes, measured by unit area of land, than any other country in the world. Unsettled conditions and weather fronts transverse the Islands at all times of the years and are responsible for spawning the tornadoes, which consequently form at all times of the year. The United Kingdom has at least 34 tornadoes per year and possibly as many as 50, more than any other country in the world relative to its land area. Most tornadoes in the United Kingdom are weak, but they are occasionally destructive. For example, the Birmingham tornado of 2005 and the London tornado of 2006 both registered F2 on the Fujita scale and both caused significant damage and injury.\n\nAssociations with various climate and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the sea surface temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season.\n\nSome evidence does suggest that the Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity, which vary by season and region, as well as whether the ENSO phase is that of El Niño or La Niña. Research has found that fewer tornadoes and hailstorms occur in winter and spring in the U.S. central and southern plains during El Niño, and more occur during La Niña, than in years when temperatures in the Pacific are relatively stable. Ocean conditions could be used to forecast extreme spring storm events several months in advance.\n\nClimatic shifts may affect tornadoes via teleconnections in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable to suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.\n\n\n\nRigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, with the advent of weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks came about in 1952. In 1953, it was confirmed that hook echoes were associated with tornadoes. By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from several miles away.\n\nToday, most developed countries have a network of weather radars, which serves as the primary method of detecting hook signatures that are likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries, Doppler weather radar stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial direction (towards or away from the radar) of the winds within a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from over 100 mi away. When storms are distant from a radar, only areas high within the storm are observed and the important areas below are not sampled. Data resolution also decreases with distance from the radar. Some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and tornado development may occasionally take place more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data. Doppler radar systems can detect mesocyclones within a supercell thunderstorm. This allows meteorologists to predict tornado formations throughout thunderstorms.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train storm spotters so they could spot key features of storms that indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as storm damage and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request these spotters to look out for severe weather and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.\n\nSpotters usually are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as sirens and the Emergency Alert System (EAS), and they forward the report to the NWS. There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States.\n\nIn Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called Canwarn, helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe and the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since 1974.\n\nStorm spotters are required because radar systems such as NEXRAD do not really detect tornadoes; merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or an imminent one, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar can't is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.\n\nStorm spotters are trained to discern whether or not a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under that updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is the formation of a rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.\n\nEvidence of a supercell is based on the storm's shape and structure, and cloud tower features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large overshooting top, a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level winds), and a corkscrew look or striations. Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and the likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a \"beaver tail\", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and rear flank downdraft, and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow.\n\nOnly wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and they usually precede the tornado between five and thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds may be a visual manifestation of a low-level mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly afterwards; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also develop without wall clouds, under flanking lines and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.\n\nThe most record-breaking tornado in recorded history was the Tri-State Tornado, which roared through parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925. It was likely an F5, though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 mi), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph) anywhere on Earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). The tornado was also the costliest tornado in history at the time (unadjusted for inflation), but in the years since has been surpassed by several others if population changes over time are not considered. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it ranks third today.\n\nThe deadliest tornado in world history was the Daultipur-Salturia Tornado in Bangladesh on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1,300 people. Bangladesh has had at least 19 tornadoes in its history kill more than 100 people, almost half of the total in the rest of the world.\n\nThe most extensive tornado outbreak on record was the 2011 Super Outbreak, which spawned 360 confirmed tornadoes over the southeastern United States – 216 of them within a single 24-hour period. The previous record was the 1974 Super Outbreak which spawned 148 tornadoes.\n\nWhile direct measurement of the most violent tornado wind speeds is nearly impossible, since conventional anemometers would be destroyed by the intense winds and flying debris, some tornadoes have been scanned by mobile Doppler radar units, which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301 ± 20 mph (484 ± 32 km/h) in the F5 Bridge Creek-Moore, Oklahoma, tornado which killed 36 people. Though the reading was taken about 100 ft above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes.\n\nStorms that produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mi/h. Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected Great Bend, Kansas, in November 1915, was an extreme case, where a \"rain of debris\" occurred 80 mi from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 mi away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of Palmyra, Nebraska, 305 mi to the northeast. Waterspouts and tornadoes have been advanced as an explanation for instances of raining fish and other animals.\n\nThough tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.\n\nSome countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as tornado watches and warnings in the United States and Canada). Weather radios provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.\n\nFolklore often identifies a green sky with tornadoes, and though the phenomenon may be associated with severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. Another commonly held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 tornado outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew and several other people take shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike and safely ride out a tornado as it passes by. However, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado, and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Due to the Venturi effect, tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass. Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at each of the three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.\n\nAn old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.\n\nThere are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by being in a city, near a major river, hill, or mountain, or even protected by supernatural forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, affect valleys, and have damaged several city centers. As a general rule, no area is safe from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others.\n\nMeteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes is newer still. Although researched for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. Scientists have a fairly good understanding of the development of thunderstorms and mesocyclones, and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation. However, the step from supercell, or other respective formative processes, to tornadogenesis and the prediction of tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well known and is the focus of much research.\n\nAlso under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level vorticity which tightens into a tornado, in particular, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone.\n\nIn particular, the role of downdrafts, particularly the rear-flank downdraft, and the role of baroclinic boundaries, are intense areas of study.\n\nReliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with mesovortices within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones.\n\nScientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.\n\nResearch programs, including field projects such as the VORTEX projects (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment), deployment of TOTO (the TOtable Tornado Observatory), Doppler on Wheels (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. Universities, government agencies such as the National Severe Storms Laboratory, private-sector meteorologists, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the National Science Foundation. The pace of research is partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken; gaps in information about the wind, pressure, and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere; and the computing power available for simulation.\n\nSolar storms similar to tornadoes have been recorded, but it is unknown how closely related they are to their terrestrial counterparts.\n\n\n","\n... me and her sister had somethin goin on\n(Aiyyo, would you listen to me motherfucker?)\nI reach my peak, I can't speak\nCall my nigga Cheek, tell him that my will is weak\n(Aiyyo c'mon nigga, cut that)\nI'm sick of niggaz lyin, I'm sick of bitches hawkin\n(Aiyyo, yoyo Big, aiyyo chill)\nMatter of fact, I'm sick of talkin\n\nDamn... we was spose to rule the world baby\nWe was unstoppable!\nThe shit can't be over, no\nThe shit can't be over man\nI know you hear me nigga\nI know you hear me\nYou got too much livin to do\nToo much unfinished business\nIt ain't over\nLive your life\n\nI'm sittin in the crib dreamin about Leer jets and coupes\nThe way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop\nOops!\nI'm interrupted by a doorbell\n3:52, who the hell\nIs this?\nI gets up quick\nCocks my shit\nStop the dogs from barkin\nThen proceed to walkin\nIts a face that I seen before\nMy nigga Sing, we used to sling on the sixteenth floor\nCheck it\nI look deeper\nI see blood up on his sneakers\nAnd his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth\nSo I dip\nNigga, is you creepin or speakin?\nHe tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the beacon\nI opens up the door, pitiful\nIs he in critical?\nRetaliation for this one won't be minimal\nCuz I'm a criminal\nWay before the rap shit\nBust a gat shit\nPuff won't even know what happened\nIf it's done smoothly\nSilencers on the Uzi\nStashed in the hooptie\nMy alibi, any cutie\nWith a booty that done fucked big Pop\nHead spinnin, reminiscin bout my man C-Rock\n\nSomebody's gotta die\nIf I go, you got to go\nSomebody's gotta die\nLet the gunshots blow\nSomebody's gotta die\nNobody got to know\nThat I killed yo ass in the mix, bitch\n\nFillin clips he explained our situation\nPrecisely, so we know exactly what we facin\nSome kid named Jason In a Honda station wagon\nWas braggin\nAbout how much loot and crack he stackin\nRock had a grip so they formed up a clique\nSmall crew\nRound the time I was locked up with you\nTrue indeed\nBut yo nigga let me proceed\nDon't fill them clips too high\nGive them bullets room to breathe\nDamn where was I?\nYeah\nOne night in town\nBlew the fuck up\nD-Rock went home\nAnd Jay got stuck the fuck up\nHit em twice\nGot em right on the Persian white\nPistol whipped his kids\nAnd taped up his wife\nHe said \"Yo Rock, set em up\", no question\nWet em up no less\nThan 50 shots in his direction\nHow many shots?\nMan nigga, I seen mad holes\nWhat kinda gats?\nHitch links, Cops, and Calicoles\nBut fuck that\nI know where all them niggaz rest at\nIn the buildin hustlin\nAnd they don't be strapped\nSupreme in black\nIs downstairs, the engine runnin\nFind a bag to put the guns in\nAnd c'mon if yo comin\n\nExchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down\nHow its gonna go down\nLay these niggas low-down\nSlow down\nFuck all that plannin shit\nRun up in they cribs\nAnd make them cats abandon ship\nSee niggas like you do ten year bids\nMiss the niggas they want\nAnd murder innocent kids\nNot I\nOne niggas in my eye\nThat's Jason\nAin't no slugs gonna be wasted\nRevenge I'm tastin at the tip of my lips\nI can't wait to feel my clip in his hips\nPass the chocolate\nThai\nSing ain't lie\nThere's Jason with his back to me\nTalkin to his faculty\nI start to get a funny feelins\nPut the mask on in case his niggas start squealin\nScream his name out\nSqueeze six nothing shorter\nNigga turned around holdin his daughter\n\nUh, uh, uh, c'mon\n\nHah, sicka than your average Poppa\nTwist cabbage off instinct niggaz don't think shit stink\nPink gators, my Detroit players\nTimbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn\n\nDead right, if they head right, Biggie there every night\nPoppa been smooth since days of Underoos\nNever lose, never choose to bruise crews who\nDo something to us, talk go through us\n\nGirls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us\nWho us?

It was done with my girlfriend who had never done it either. My experience with drugs consists of chemicals such as MDMA, MDA, MDE, Methamphetamine ' by accident, thinking the were Ecstasy pills, Ketamine, Dipenhydramine (Dramamine), Adderall, Vicadin and plants such as marijuana and mushrooms.\n\nSetting: My friend's apartment with no one home except my girlfriend and I, very trippy one floor apartment weird pictures on the walls and interesting color schemes. Outside the weather is awful, raining/snowing/sleeting and cold. The night before, well about 1 that morning we took about 250 mg of Ketamine each at a rave and sniffed Rush, so that might have been a factor in the upcoming trip. At around 12:30 pm we dropped 3 tabs each and waited.\n\nT+1 hour: Starting to feel odd, just straight out weird, a bit anxious, I can feel it in my stomach its really annoying, we're giggling about everything mocking the cats in the house, I don't even know why, it was just funny. We start seeing some visuals, things turning and spiraling and patterns emerging and such, nothing brilliant but hey it was entertaining, the nausea is subsiding a bit. All of a sudden my friend (whose house I was at) comes into the house crying, and I think 'oh shit, tell me this isn't just a perfectly clich' event to lead us onto a bad trip.'\n\nSo I go into the other room and that's when the fear starts coming, because we just started coming up fairly strong when my friend came in and I'm like damnet, so I started thinking of like all these terrible things associated with evil and death and it was just scary, and I was on the VERGE of freaking out when my girlfriend came in and comforted me, saying how she was okay and my friend had made her hot chocolate. So I calmed down a bit, my friend left and it was us 2 again in the house.\n\nT+2 hours: I'm starting to get reallly paranoid of my friends mom coming home, even though I knew for a fact she would not be home till about 6:30 and it was about 2 or 2:30. I kept trying to comprehend what was happening as nothing was real anymore, patterns emerged from every crevice of the room, the music was incredible but I just felt SO weird I couldn't take it. I was in a continual thought loop trying to figure out what was going on. I kept getting real scared and I just wanted it to end. My girlfriend calmed me down a bit, it took a while but she did. Making out is real weird, I got bizarre mental visions. I kept envisioning weird colors in my mind.\n\nT+2.5 hours: Now the ceiling is raining rainbows, though the ceiling is actually white, and occasionally I see bursts of butterflies or it would start raining roses down on us. I was getting antsy again as I didn't know what to do with myself, we were literally stuck in the house because we couldn't go outside. The reason we couldn't go outside is when we looked out the window the trees turned alive and multiplied their branches and were just terrifying.\n\nStaring at the water on the ground from the second story window, the water turned into multitudes of letters and formed words. I was looking at black crows go by and right after they went by, a good 100+ more crows flew by in different areas of the sky (obviously hallucinations). So overall outside was too scary, but we didn't know what to do. I couldn't escape my mind which was on sensory overload. If there was no music I would hear sounds possibly miles away as if they were right next to me, and what was worse was they echoed - LOUD. And then there were more and more and more noises to the point where I couldn't be in the room.\n\nT+3 hours: The acid was getting to me. I kept thinking that this wouldn't end and I'd be in a world that wasn't real forever, nothing was real anymore, the fan was alive, the walls were alive, the blankets were alive, the floor was alive. Patterns melted into each other, and then formed new ones, from those patterns came new ones. The tracers were unbelievable, I'd be able to swing my hands around and I could move the color/pattern scheme of one object right onto another object. If the wall was striped I could bring the stripes onto the floor.\n\nAs I walked into each room I began turning every light on in the apartment to make everything glow its own individual color. And it did, as I walked into the kitchen everything was green, we decided we were hungry but couldn't eat anything so I took out clementimes. The problem was they were green, so we thought they were bad. The problem was that we forgot that when oranges are green it just means there not totally ripe. Somehow we thought that it was like bread, which turns green (mold) when it's bad, so it took us a while to figure that out.\n\nT+4 hours: I am crazy. I am so far gone that I actually gave up. When my girlfriend was wondering the apartment, I decided to sit in this little tiny back room next to the refrigerator and wait it out. My girlfriend, being the persistent little girl she is came in and sat with me and basically talked me through it somehow. The irony is that I'm about 1000x more experienced than her but she managed to talk me into being happy. At one point I saw a train go by the window and my girlfriend saw a little girl standing in the middle of the room pointing towards a chandelier.\n\nAt this point the music started getting overwhelming, my music selection was shitty as I kind of just figured pink Floyd would be amazing, but in fact it was so bizarre it was actually scaring me so we vigorously searched through my friend's selection and found Good Charlotte. Yes - good charlotte, we put it in and it was so corny that it made me happy! So were tripping out on the floor in her living room as my girlfriend is peeling/feeding me oranges and listening to Good Charlotte. By the way, eating fruit you like is a must; it beats any munchies I've ever ingested.\n\nT+5 hours: At this point the mental part of the trip is diminishing, I have almost complete control of my mind which is wonderful because I'm totally not paranoid anymore and overall I'm just happy. But the great thing was, was the visuals were still increasing in intensity. The most beautiful patterns I've ever seen are appearing everywhere, everywhere I looked things were alive, and it was magnificent. On top of that, I was starting to melt from time to time. I would actually feel my fingers extending or growing or getting fat/thin and I'd see it as well. In fact I even showed my girlfriend how my fingers were stretching and she saw it as I saw it and as I felt it.\n\nI was also, as well, able to control the movement of certain things with certain body parts, for example as my hand grew and shrank and moved I could move the door in that same fashion. As with looking at ourselves and each other, when I looked at my girlfriend her head would grow and shrink, and her eyes would grow huge, as well as her feet, but the rest of her body shrunk. It was if we were in Sonic the Hedgehog or Mario - actually she looked like a hedgehog, or tails from Sonic. At one point I saw my girlfriend was doing something weird with her arm, she was like trying to grab something in the sleeve of her sweatshirt with her hand. I asked her what she was doing and she said that her hand was lonely and wanted to meet another body part.\n\nAt one point we were standing in the kitchen and I was saying how I was hungry and could go for a snickers bar. All of a sudden she's like 'Yeah! Jesse.' and that was it. I knew the rest of what she was going to say as one time Jesse gave us a snickers bar when we came home rolling and needed food bad, I knew the rest of what she was going to say because her memory actually transferred to me visually, I saw it happen in front of my eyes at that moment.\n\nT+6 hours: At this point the visuals are receding, but just barely, the thought process was still really weird/fun. We took up some recreational time by drawing; I drew on her as she drew on a piece of paper. It looks like a mushroom but upside down it's supposed to have facial features. This was my girlfriend's doing, creative eh?\n\nT+8 hours: Sexual activity is fun, and were just having fun, things are still visually interesting, many things still breathing and swirling and very fun too look at, many patterns are still manifesting the house. We're laughing about a lot of things again and my girlfriend was sticking her tongue out at some poster cos she thought he was mean. haha.\n\nT+9 hours we were still seeing visuals but my dad came and picked us up and brought my girlfriend home. When I came home I ate food, which was kinda icky, and talked to my girlfriend on the phone till 3 am - visuals were still here, I have some trippy shit in my room, lava lamps, electricity balls, etc. And they were making butterflies all over my ceiling.\n\nThe next morning I felt fairly fine, a bit brain dead. I wasn't too enthused to go to work for 6 hours, but managed to go and didn't do to bad. Currently, the next day at 7:30 pm I feel almost completely back to normal.\n\nOverall this was probably the most intense, but greatest more glorious experience of my entire life. I will definitely do it again, maybe next time in a better setting like outside in a park or in my room at night with my girlfriend of course, after all she did save my sanity.\n\n","I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed\nto live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to\ntell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that\nhis seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers.\nThey all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men,\nas well as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or\nwhether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I\nhave never been quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean\njoker is a rara avis in terris.\n\nAbout the refinements, or, as he called them, the ‘ghost’ of wit, the\nking troubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for\nbreadth in a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake\nof it. Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais’\n‘Gargantua’ to the ‘Zadig’ of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical\njokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones.\n\nAt the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone\nout of fashion at court. Several of the great continental ‘powers’ still\nretain their ‘fools,’ who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were\nexpected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice,\nin consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.\n\nOur king, as a matter of course, retained his ‘fool.’ The fact is, he\nrequired something in the way of folly--if only to counterbalance\nthe heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers--not to\nmention himself.\n\nHis fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His\nvalue was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also\na dwarf and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days,\nas fools; and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through\ntheir days (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both\na jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already\nobserved, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat,\nround, and unwieldy--so that it was no small source of self-gratulation\nwith our king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed\na triplicate treasure in one person.\n\nI believe the name ‘Hop-Frog’ was not that given to the dwarf by his\nsponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent\nof the several ministers, on account of his inability to walk as\nother men do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of\ninterjectional gait--something between a leap and a wriggle--a movement\nthat afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to\nthe king, for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a\nconstitutional swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was\naccounted a capital figure.\n\nBut although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could\nmove only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the\nprodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his\narms, by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled\nhim to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes\nwere in question, or any thing else to climb. At such exercises he\ncertainly much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a\nfrog.\n\nI am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog\noriginally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that\nno person ever heard of--a vast distance from the court of our king.\nHop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself\n(although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been\nforcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces,\nand sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious\ngenerals.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close\nintimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became\nsworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport,\nwas by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta\nmany services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty\n(although a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed\nmuch influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the\nbenefit of Hop-Frog.\n\nOn some grand state occasion--I forgot what--the king determined to\nhave a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,\noccurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta\nwere sure to be called into play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so\ninventive in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel\ncharacters, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could\nbe done, it seems, without his assistance.\n\nThe night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been\nfitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could\npossibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of\nexpectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed\nthat everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made\nup their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a\nmonth, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision\nanywhere--except in the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why\nthey hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke.\nMore probably, they found it difficult, on account of being so fat, to\nmake up their minds. At all events, time flew; and, as a last resort\nthey sent for Trippetta and Hop-Frog.\n\nWhen the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found\nhim sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council;\nbut the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew that\nHop-Frog was not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to\nmadness; and madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king loved his\npractical jokes, and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as\nthe king called it) ‘to be merry.’\n\n“Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the\nroom; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here\nHop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention.\nWe want characters--characters, man--something novel--out of the way. We\nare wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the wine will\nbrighten your wits.”\n\nHop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these\nadvances from the king; but the effort was too much. It happened to\nbe the poor dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his ‘absent\nfriends’ forced the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell\ninto the goblet as he took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.\n\n“Ah! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly drained the\nbeaker.--“See what a glass of good wine can do! Why, your eyes are\nshining already!”\n\nPoor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect\nof wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous.\nHe placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the\ncompany with a half--insane stare. They all seemed highly amused at the\nsuccess of the king’s ‘joke.’\n\n“And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man.\n\n“Yes,” said the King; “Come lend us your assistance. Characters, my fine\nfellow; we stand in need of characters--all of us--ha! ha! ha!” and\nas this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the\nseven.\n\nHop-Frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly.\n\n“Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”\n\n“I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf,\nabstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine.\n\n“Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you mean by that?\nAh, I perceive. You are Sulky, and want more wine. Here, drink this!”\n and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple, who\nmerely gazed at it, gasping for breath.\n\n“Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the fiends-”\n\nThe dwarf hesitated. The king grew purple with rage. The courtiers\nsmirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat,\nand, falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.\n\nThe tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at\nher audacity. He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say--how most\nbecomingly to express his indignation. At last, without uttering a\nsyllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of\nthe brimming goblet in her face.\n\nThe poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh,\nresumed her position at the foot of the table.\n\nThere was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the\nfalling of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. It was\ninterrupted by a low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which\nseemed to come at once from every corner of the room.\n\n“What--what--what are you making that noise for?” demanded the king,\nturning furiously to the dwarf.\n\nThe latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his\nintoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face,\nmerely ejaculated:\n\n“I--I? How could it have been me?”\n\n“The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the\ncourtiers. “I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill\nupon his cage-wires.”\n\n“True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion;\n“but, on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the\ngritting of this vagabond’s teeth.”\n\nHereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object\nto any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very\nrepulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow\nas much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained\nanother bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at\nonce, and with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.\n\n“I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very\ntranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just\nafter your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her\nface--just after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was\nmaking that odd noise outside the window, there came into my mind a\ncapital diversion--one of my own country frolics--often enacted\namong us, at our masquerades: but here it will be new altogether.\nUnfortunately, however, it requires a company of eight persons and-”\n\n“Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the\ncoincidence; “eight to a fraction--I and my seven ministers. Come! what\nis the diversion?”\n\n“We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs,\nand it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”\n\n“We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering\nhis eyelids.\n\n“The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it\noccasions among the women.”\n\n“Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.\n\n“I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all\nthat to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of\nmasqueraders will take you for real beasts--and of course, they will be\nas much terrified as astonished.”\n\n“Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king. “Hop-Frog! I will make a\nman of you.”\n\n“The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their\njangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.\nYour majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by\neight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the\ncompany; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately\nand gorgeously habited men and women. The contrast is inimitable!”\n\n“It must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was\ngrowing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog.\n\nHis mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but\neffective enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the\nepoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized\nworld; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently\nbeast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to\nnature was thus thought to be secured.\n\nThe king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet\nshirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage\nof the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the\nsuggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the\neight, by ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the\nourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flu. A thick\ncoating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar.\nA long chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of\nthe king, and tied, then about another of the party, and also tied;\nthen about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining\narrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each\nother as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear\nnatural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters,\nat right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the\npresent day, by those who capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in\nBorneo.\n\nThe grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a\ncircular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only\nthrough a single window at top. At night (the season for which the\napartment was especially designed) it was illuminated principally by a\nlarge chandelier, depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light,\nand lowered, or elevated, by means of a counter-balance as usual; but\n(in order not to look unsightly) this latter passed outside the cupola\nand over the roof.\n\nThe arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta’s\nsuperintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided\nby the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was\nthat, on this occasion, the chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings\n(which, in weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would\nhave been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who,\non account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected\nto keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier.\nAdditional sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the\nwar, and a flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand\nof each of the Caryaides [Caryatides] that stood against the wall--some\nfifty or sixty altogether.\n\nThe eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog’s advice, waited patiently\nuntil midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders)\nbefore making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased striking,\nhowever, than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together--for the\nimpediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to\nstumble as they entered.\n\nThe excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the\nheart of the king with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not\na few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be\nbeasts of some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many\nof the women swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the\nprecaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon\nhave expiated their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general rush\nwas made for the doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked\nimmediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys\nhad been deposited with him.\n\nWhile the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only\nto his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the\npressure of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier\nordinarily hung, and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have\nbeen seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came\nwithin three feet of the floor.\n\nSoon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the\nhall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and,\nof course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus\nsituated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels,\ninciting them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain\nat the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle\ndiametrically and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought,\nhe inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend;\nand, in an instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was\ndrawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an\ninevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close\nconnection, and face to face.\n\nThe masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure,\nfrom their alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a\nwell-contrived pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the\npredicament of the apes.\n\n“Leave them to me!” now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making\nitself easily heard through all the din. “Leave them to me. I fancy I\nknow them. If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who\nthey are.”\n\nHere, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the\nwall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned,\nas he went, to the centre of the room-leaping, with the agility of a\nmonkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the\nchain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs,\nand still screaming: “I shall soon find out who they are!”\n\nAnd now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed\nwith laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the\nchain flew violently up for about thirty feet--dragging with it the\ndismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in\nmid-air between the sky-light and the floor. Hop-Frog, clinging to the\nchain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to\nthe eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued\nto thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover\nwho they were.\n\nSo thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a\ndead silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued. It was broken by\njust such a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the\nattention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine\nin the face of Trippetta. But, on the present occasion, there could be\nno question as to whence the sound issued. It came from the fang--like\nteeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at\nthe mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the\nupturned countenances of the king and his seven companions.\n\n“Ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester. “Ah, ha! I begin to see\nwho these people are now!” Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more\nclosely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him,\nand which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than half\na minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the\nshrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken,\nand without the power to render them the slightest assistance.\n\nAt length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the\njester to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as\nhe made this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into\nsilence. The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:\n\n“I now see distinctly.” he said, “what manner of people these maskers\nare. They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,--a king who\ndoes not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors\nwho abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the\njester--and this is my last jest.”\n\nOwing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which\nit adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech\nbefore the work of vengeance was complete. The eight corpses swung in\ntheir chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable\nmass. The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the\nceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light.\n\nIt is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon,\nhad been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that,\ntogether, they effected their escape to their own country: for neither\nwas seen again.\n\n","Eh.2nd or 3rd floor?","Article 2101: General Exceptions\n1.

It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?\nAbsolutely. Okay, first we’ll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn’t work we can go back to…\nY'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.\nOh no-no, never say that. If we can’t get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.\nOr instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.\nOkay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller?

Yeah, okay.\nYou have a Miss Monica Geller here.\nUh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.\nWhat the hell is this?\nHang on a second. I’m sorry what?\nSeriously, what is this supposed to mean?\nWell, y’know, I never know how much to tip.\nYou’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?\nUmm, I’m still here.\nYou’re taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn’t leave you that tip, you wouldn’t of come down here, we wouldn’t be having this argument, and there wouldn’t be this ah, heat between us.\nWhat?!\nCome on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. ‘Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we’re like this-this couple that fights.\nOkay, umm, you’re a loon.\nLook, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you’re great. Come on, what do you say?\nI don’t know.\nWhy not?\n‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.\nOne meal! That’s all I’m asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don’t have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.\nWait, no! Just put the mail down. It’s-it’s me!\nOkay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?\nOh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I’d curl up in it. Is that all right?\nOh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?\nOh, well just probably the worst one since I’ve been alive.\nWhat umm, what happened?\nUmm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.\nOh no. Did umm, did she say why?\nUh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’t see how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was when we first got together.\nYeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best?\nYeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!\nOh, sweetie, oh.\nY'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it’s still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why!\nUh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?\nWhat?\nUmm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.\nWait a minute, wait, this is because of you?\nOkay.\nWell, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.\nOkay, but.\nWait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you’d understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go…\nOh my God! The millionaire’s here!Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?\nOkay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.\nI know!!\nOkay, then get the lobster!\nHey!\nHi.\nHi!!\nHey!\nHi!\nHey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?\nAnd that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.\nOh-no-no-no-no….\nJust one drink?!\nSo, where do you want to go?\nHey, you like pizza?\nOh, that’s sounds great.\nI know a great little place.\nYou’re, hey, you’re not paying for the pizza!\nOh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?\nAhh, I’d throw another thousand on that.\nWhy, how much is that?\nThat’s about 60 cents.\nEvery night!!\nHypnosis Tape: You do not need to smoke.

The sledge was shaped like a great golden\nswan, and between the swan’s wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her\nlong ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny\ncap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she\nhad always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets\nall the people wondered.  “She is like a white rose!” they cried, and\nthey threw down flowers on her from the balconies.\n\nAt the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had\ndreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he\nsank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\n\n“Your picture was beautiful,” he murmured, “but you are more beautiful\nthan your picture”; and the little Princess blushed.\n\n“She was like a white rose before,” said a young Page to his neighbour,\n“but she is like a red rose now”; and the whole Court was delighted.\n\nFor the next three days everybody went about saying, “White rose, Red\nrose, Red rose, White rose”; and the King gave orders that the Page’s\nsalary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not\nof much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly\npublished in the Court Gazette.\n\nWhen the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a\nmagnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand\nunder a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then\nthere was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and\nPrincess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear\ncrystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips\ntouched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.\n\n“It’s quite clear that they love each other,” said the little Page, “as\nclear as crystal!” and the King doubled his salary a second time.  “What\nan honour!” cried all the courtiers.\n\nAfter the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were\nto dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the\nflute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so,\nbecause he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never\nquite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for,\nwhatever he did, everybody cried out, “Charming! charming!”\n\nThe last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be\nlet off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a\nfirework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal\nPyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.\n\n“What are fireworks like?” she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she\nwas walking on the terrace.\n\n“They are like the Aurora Borealis,” said the King, who always answered\nquestions that were addressed to other people, “only much more natural.\nI prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to\nappear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must\ncertainly see them.”\n\nSo at the end of the King’s garden a great stand had been set up, and as\nsoon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place,\nthe fireworks began to talk to each other.\n\n“The world is certainly very beautiful,” cried a little Squib.  “Just\nlook at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could\nnot be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the\nmind wonderfully, and does away with all one’s prejudices.”\n\n“The King’s garden is not the world, you foolish squib,” said a big Roman\nCandle; “the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days\nto see it thoroughly.”\n\n“Any place you love is the world to you,” exclaimed a pensive Catherine\nWheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided\nherself on her broken heart; “but love is not fashionable any more, the\npoets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed\nthem, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I\nremember myself once—But it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the\npast.”\n\n“Nonsense!” said the Roman Candle, “Romance never dies.  It is like the\nmoon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love\neach other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a\nbrown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as\nmyself, and knew the latest Court news.”\n\nBut the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  “Romance is dead, Romance is\ndead, Romance is dead,” she murmured.  She was one of those people who\nthink that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times,\nit becomes true in the end.\n\nSuddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.\n\nIt came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end\nof a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as\nto attract attention.\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine\nWheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, “Romance is dead.”\n\n“Order! order!” cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician,\nand had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew\nthe proper Parliamentary expressions to use.\n\n“Quite dead,” whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.\n\nAs soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and\nbegan.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating\nhis memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he\nwas talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.\n\n“How fortunate it is for the King’s son,” he remarked, “that he is to be\nmarried on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had\nbeen arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him;\nbut, Princes are always lucky.”\n\n“Dear me!” said the little Squib, “I thought it was quite the other way,\nand that we were to be let off in the Prince’s honour.”\n\n“It may be so with you,” he answered; “indeed, I have no doubt that it\nis, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come\nof remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel\nof her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her\ngreat public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went\nout, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink\nstars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very\nbest gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French\nextraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would\nnever come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly\ndisposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden\nrain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering\nterms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic\nart.”\n\n“Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,” said a Bengal Light; “I know it is\nPyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.”\n\n“Well, I said Pylotechnic,” answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of\nvoice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to\nbully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of\nsome importance.\n\n“I was saying,” continued the Rocket, “I was saying—What was I saying?”\n\n“You were talking about yourself,” replied the Roman Candle.\n\n“Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was\nso rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind,\nfor I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive\nas I am, I am quite sure of that.”\n\n“What is a sensitive person?” said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.\n\n“A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other\npeople’s toes,” answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the\nCracker nearly exploded with laughter.\n\n“Pray, what are you laughing at?” inquired the Rocket; “I am not\nlaughing.”\n\n“I am laughing because I am happy,” replied the Cracker.\n\n“That is a very selfish reason,” said the Rocket angrily.  “What right\nhave you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you\nshould be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I\nexpect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.\nIt is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose,\nfor instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that\nwould be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy\nagain, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I\nknow he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the\nimportance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.”\n\n“If you want to give pleasure to others,” cried the Roman Candle, “you\nhad better keep yourself dry.”\n\n“Certainly,” exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits;\n“that is only common sense.”\n\n“Common sense, indeed!” said the Rocket indignantly; “you forget that I\nam very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common\nsense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination,\nfor I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as\nbeing quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no\none here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for\nmyself, I don’t care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is\nthe consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this\nis a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any\nhearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and\nPrincess had not just been married.”\n\n“Well, really,” exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, “why not?  It is a most\njoyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the\nstars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about\nthe pretty bride.”\n\n“Ah! what a trivial view of life!” said the Rocket; “but it is only what\nI expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why,\nperhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there\nis a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little\nfair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps\nsome day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may\ngo to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall\ninto the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor\npeople, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall\nnever get over it.”\n\n“But they have not lost their only son,” said the Roman Candle; “no\nmisfortune has happened to them at all.”\n\n“I never said that they had,” replied the Rocket; “I said that they\nmight.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying\nanything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.\nBut when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very\nmuch affected.”\n\n“You certainly are!” cried the Bengal Light.  “In fact, you are the most\naffected person I ever met.”\n\n“You are the rudest person I ever met,” said the Rocket, “and you cannot\nunderstand my friendship for the Prince.”\n\n“Why, you don’t even know him,” growled the Roman Candle.\n\n“I never said I knew him,” answered the Rocket.  “I dare say that if I\nknew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing\nto know one’s friends.”\n\n“You had really better keep yourself dry,” said the Fire-balloon.  “That\nis the important thing.”\n\n“Very important for you, I have no doubt,” answered the Rocket, “but I\nshall weep if I choose”; and he actually burst into real tears, which\nflowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little\nbeetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were\nlooking for a nice dry spot to live in.\n\n“He must have a truly romantic nature,” said the Catherine Wheel, “for he\nweeps when there is nothing at all to weep about”; and she heaved a deep\nsigh, and thought about the deal box.\n\nBut the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept\nsaying, “Humbug! humbug!” at the top of their voices.  They were\nextremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called\nit humbug.\n\nThen the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to\nshine, and a sound of music came from the palace.\n\nThe Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so\nbeautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and\nwatched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.\n\nThen ten o’clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the\nlast stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King\nsent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.\n\n“Let the fireworks begin,” said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made\na low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six\nattendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a\nlong pole.\n\nIt was certainly a magnificent display.\n\nWhizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.\nBoom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the\nplace, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  “Good-bye,”\ncried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.\nBang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves\nimmensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.\nHe was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best\nthing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it\nwas of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak,\nexcept with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers\nwith blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little\nPrincess laughed with pleasure.\n\n“I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,” said the\nRocket; “no doubt that is what it means,” and he looked more supercilious\nthan ever.\n\nThe next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  “This is evidently\na deputation,” said the Rocket; “I will receive them with becoming\ndignity” so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if\nhe were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no\nnotice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them\ncaught sight of him.  “Hallo!” he cried, “what a bad rocket!” and he\nthrew him over the wall into the ditch.\n\n“BAD Rocket?  BAD Rocket?” he said, as he whirled through the air;\n“impossible!  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.  BAD and GRAND\nsound very much the same, indeed they often are the same”; and he fell\ninto the mud.\n\n“It is not comfortable here,” he remarked, “but no doubt it is some\nfashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my\nhealth.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require\nrest.”\n\nThen a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat,\nswam up to him.\n\n“A new arrival, I see!” said the Frog.  “Well, after all there is nothing\nlike mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do\nyou think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky\nis quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket, and he began to cough.\n\n“What a delightful voice you have!” cried the Frog.  “Really it is quite\nlike a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the\nworld.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck\npond close by the farmer’s house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.\nIt is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact,\nit was only yesterday that I heard the farmer’s wife say to her mother\nthat she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is\nmost gratifying to find oneself so popular.”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he\ncould not get a word in.\n\n“A delightful voice, certainly,” continued the Frog; “I hope you will\ncome over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have\nsix beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He\nis a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off\nthem.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I\nassure you.”\n\n“Conversation, indeed!” said the Rocket.  “You have talked the whole time\nyourself.  That is not conversation.”\n\n“Somebody must listen,” answered the Frog, “and I like to do all the\ntalking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.”\n\n“But I like arguments,” said the Rocket.\n\n“I hope not,” said the Frog complacently.  “Arguments are extremely\nvulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.\nGood-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little\nFrog swam away.\n\n“You are a very irritating person,” said the Rocket, “and very ill-bred.\nI hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to\ntalk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and\nselfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my\ntemperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you\nshould take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.\nNow that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I\nam going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at\nCourt; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my\nhonour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a\nprovincial.”\n\n“There is no good talking to him,” said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on\nthe top of a large brown bulrush; “no good at all, for he has gone away.”\n\n“Well, that is his loss, not mine,” answered the Rocket.  “I am not going\nto stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like\nhearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have\nlong conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I\ndon’t understand a single word of what I am saying.”\n\n“Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,” said the Dragon-fly;\nand he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.\n\n“How very silly of him not to stay here!” said the Rocket.  “I am sure\nthat he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However,\nI don’t care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some\nday”; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.\n\nAfter some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs,\nand webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her\nwaddle.\n\n“Quack, quack, quack,” she said.  “What a curious shape you are!  May I\nask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?”\n\n“It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,” answered\nthe Rocket, “otherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your\nignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable\nas oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up\ninto the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.”\n\n“I don’t think much of that,” said the Duck, “as I cannot see what use it\nis to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw\na cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that\nwould be something.”\n\n“My good creature,” cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, “I\nsee that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is\nnever useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than\nsufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least\nof all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have\nalways been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who\nhave nothing whatever to do.”\n\n“Well, well,” said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and\nnever quarrelled with any one, “everybody has different tastes.  I hope,\nat any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.”\n\n“Oh! dear no,” cried the Rocket.  “I am merely a visitor, a distinguished\nvisitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is\nneither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban.\nI shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make\na sensation in the world.”\n\n“I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,” remarked the Duck;\n“there are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair\nat a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning\neverything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much\neffect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.”\n\n“I am made for public life,” said the Rocket, “and so are all my\nrelations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great\nattention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will\nbe a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and\ndistracts one’s mind from higher things.”\n\n“Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!” said the Duck; “and\nthat reminds me how hungry I feel”: and she swam away down the stream,\nsaying, “Quack, quack, quack.”\n\n“Come back! come back!” screamed the Rocket, “I have a great deal to say\nto you”; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  “I am glad that she has\ngone,” he said to himself, “she has a decidedly middle-class mind”; and\nhe sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the\nloneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came\nrunning down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.\n\n“This must be the deputation,” said the Rocket, and he tried to look very\ndignified.\n\n“Hallo!” cried one of the boys, “look at this old stick!  I wonder how it\ncame here”; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.\n\n“OLD Stick!” said the Rocket, “impossible!  GOLD Stick, that is what he\nsaid.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one\nof the Court dignitaries!”\n\n“Let us put it into the fire!” said the other boy, “it will help to boil\nthe kettle.”\n\nSo they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit\nthe fire.\n\n“This is magnificent,” cried the Rocket, “they are going to let me off in\nbroad day-light, so that every one can see me.”\n\n“We will go to sleep now,” they said, “and when we wake up the kettle\nwill be boiled”; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.\n\nThe Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last,\nhowever, the fire caught him.\n\n“Now I am going off!” he cried, and he made himself very stiff and\nstraight.  “I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher\nthan the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high\nthat—”\n\nFizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.\n\n“Delightful!” he cried, “I shall go on like this for ever.  What a\nsuccess I am!”\n\nBut nobody saw him.\n\nThen he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.\n\n“Now I am going to explode,” he cried.  “I shall set the whole world on\nfire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for\na whole year.”  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the\ngunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.\n\nBut nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound\nasleep.\n\nThen all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the\nback of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.\n\n“Good heavens!” cried the Goose.  “It is going to rain sticks”; and she\nrushed into the water.\n\n“I knew I should create a great sensation,” gasped the Rocket, and he\nwent out.\n\n","Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night and wouldn't you love to love her?\nTakes to the sky like a bird in flight and who will be her lover?\n\nAll your life you've never seen a woman taken by the wind.\nWould you stay if she promised you heaven?\nWill you ever win?\n\nShe is like a cat in the dark and then she is the darkness.\nShe rules her life like a fine skylark and when the sky is starless.\n\nShe rings like a bell through the night and wouldn't you love to love her?\nShe rules her life like a bird in flight and who will be her lover?\n\n","So long ago, certain place, certain time, you touched my hand.\nAll the way down to Emmiline, but if our paths never cross, well you know I'm sorry but if I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.\nI'll never live to match the beauty again, the rainbow's end.\n\nSo it's hard to find someone with that kind of intensity.\nYou touched my hand I played it cool.\n\nSo long ago, it's a certain time, it's a certain place.\nYou touched my hand and you smiled all the way back you held out your hand.\nIf I hope and I pray, ooh it might work out someday.\nIf I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.\nI'll never live to match the beauty again.\n\n","THE King’s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.\nHe had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.\nShe was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a\nsledge drawn by six reindeer.  The sledge was shaped like a great golden\nswan, and between the swan’s wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her\nlong ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny\ncap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she\nhad always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets\nall the people wondered.  “She is like a white rose!” they cried, and\nthey threw down flowers on her from the balconies.\n\nAt the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had\ndreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he\nsank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\n\n“Your picture was beautiful,” he murmured, “but you are more beautiful\nthan your picture”; and the little Princess blushed.\n\n“She was like a white rose before,” said a young Page to his neighbour,\n“but she is like a red rose now”; and the whole Court was delighted.\n\nFor the next three days everybody went about saying, “White rose, Red\nrose, Red rose, White rose”; and the King gave orders that the Page’s\nsalary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not\nof much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly\npublished in the Court Gazette.\n\nWhen the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a\nmagnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand\nunder a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then\nthere was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and\nPrincess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear\ncrystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips\ntouched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.\n\n“It’s quite clear that they love each other,” said the little Page, “as\nclear as crystal!” and the King doubled his salary a second time.  “What\nan honour!” cried all the courtiers.\n\nAfter the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were\nto dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the\nflute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so,\nbecause he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never\nquite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for,\nwhatever he did, everybody cried out, “Charming! charming!”\n\nThe last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be\nlet off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a\nfirework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal\nPyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.\n\n“What are fireworks like?” she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she\nwas walking on the terrace.\n\n“They are like the Aurora Borealis,” said the King, who always answered\nquestions that were addressed to other people, “only much more natural.\nI prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to\nappear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must\ncertainly see them.”\n\nSo at the end of the King’s garden a great stand had been set up, and as\nsoon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place,\nthe fireworks began to talk to each other.\n\n“The world is certainly very beautiful,” cried a little Squib.  “Just\nlook at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could\nnot be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the\nmind wonderfully, and does away with all one’s prejudices.”\n\n“The King’s garden is not the world, you foolish squib,” said a big Roman\nCandle; “the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days\nto see it thoroughly.”\n\n“Any place you love is the world to you,” exclaimed a pensive Catherine\nWheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided\nherself on her broken heart; “but love is not fashionable any more, the\npoets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed\nthem, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I\nremember myself once—But it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the\npast.”\n\n“Nonsense!” said the Roman Candle, “Romance never dies.  It is like the\nmoon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love\neach other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a\nbrown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as\nmyself, and knew the latest Court news.”\n\nBut the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  “Romance is dead, Romance is\ndead, Romance is dead,” she murmured.  She was one of those people who\nthink that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times,\nit becomes true in the end.\n\nSuddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.\n\nIt came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end\nof a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as\nto attract attention.\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine\nWheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, “Romance is dead.”\n\n“Order! order!” cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician,\nand had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew\nthe proper Parliamentary expressions to use.\n\n“Quite dead,” whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.\n\nAs soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and\nbegan.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating\nhis memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he\nwas talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.\n\n“How fortunate it is for the King’s son,” he remarked, “that he is to be\nmarried on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had\nbeen arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him;\nbut, Princes are always lucky.”\n\n“Dear me!” said the little Squib, “I thought it was quite the other way,\nand that we were to be let off in the Prince’s honour.”\n\n“It may be so with you,” he answered; “indeed, I have no doubt that it\nis, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come\nof remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel\nof her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her\ngreat public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went\nout, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink\nstars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very\nbest gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French\nextraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would\nnever come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly\ndisposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden\nrain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering\nterms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic\nart.”\n\n“Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,” said a Bengal Light; “I know it is\nPyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.”\n\n“Well, I said Pylotechnic,” answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of\nvoice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to\nbully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of\nsome importance.\n\n“I was saying,” continued the Rocket, “I was saying—What was I saying?”\n\n“You were talking about yourself,” replied the Roman Candle.\n\n“Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was\nso rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind,\nfor I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive\nas I am, I am quite sure of that.”\n\n“What is a sensitive person?” said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.\n\n“A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other\npeople’s toes,” answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the\nCracker nearly exploded with laughter.\n\n“Pray, what are you laughing at?” inquired the Rocket; “I am not\nlaughing.”\n\n“I am laughing because I am happy,” replied the Cracker.\n\n“That is a very selfish reason,” said the Rocket angrily.  “What right\nhave you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you\nshould be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I\nexpect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.\nIt is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose,\nfor instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that\nwould be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy\nagain, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I\nknow he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the\nimportance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.”\n\n“If you want to give pleasure to others,” cried the Roman Candle, “you\nhad better keep yourself dry.”\n\n“Certainly,” exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits;\n“that is only common sense.”\n\n“Common sense, indeed!” said the Rocket indignantly; “you forget that I\nam very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common\nsense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination,\nfor I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as\nbeing quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no\none here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for\nmyself, I don’t care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is\nthe consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this\nis a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any\nhearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and\nPrincess had not just been married.”\n\n“Well, really,” exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, “why not?  It is a most\njoyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the\nstars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about\nthe pretty bride.”\n\n“Ah! what a trivial view of life!” said the Rocket; “but it is only what\nI expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why,\nperhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there\nis a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little\nfair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps\nsome day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may\ngo to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall\ninto the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor\npeople, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall\nnever get over it.”\n\n“But they have not lost their only son,” said the Roman Candle; “no\nmisfortune has happened to them at all.”\n\n“I never said that they had,” replied the Rocket; “I said that they\nmight.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying\nanything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.\nBut when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very\nmuch affected.”\n\n“You certainly are!” cried the Bengal Light.  “In fact, you are the most\naffected person I ever met.”\n\n“You are the rudest person I ever met,” said the Rocket, “and you cannot\nunderstand my friendship for the Prince.”\n\n“Why, you don’t even know him,” growled the Roman Candle.\n\n“I never said I knew him,” answered the Rocket.  “I dare say that if I\nknew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing\nto know one’s friends.”\n\n“You had really better keep yourself dry,” said the Fire-balloon.  “That\nis the important thing.”\n\n“Very important for you, I have no doubt,” answered the Rocket, “but I\nshall weep if I choose”; and he actually burst into real tears, which\nflowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little\nbeetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were\nlooking for a nice dry spot to live in.\n\n“He must have a truly romantic nature,” said the Catherine Wheel, “for he\nweeps when there is nothing at all to weep about”; and she heaved a deep\nsigh, and thought about the deal box.\n\nBut the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept\nsaying, “Humbug! humbug!” at the top of their voices.  They were\nextremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called\nit humbug.\n\nThen the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to\nshine, and a sound of music came from the palace.\n\nThe Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so\nbeautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and\nwatched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.\n\nThen ten o’clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the\nlast stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King\nsent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.\n\n“Let the fireworks begin,” said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made\na low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six\nattendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a\nlong pole.\n\nIt was certainly a magnificent display.\n\nWhizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.\nBoom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the\nplace, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  “Good-bye,”\ncried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.\nBang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves\nimmensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.\nHe was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best\nthing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it\nwas of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak,\nexcept with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers\nwith blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little\nPrincess laughed with pleasure.\n\n“I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,” said the\nRocket; “no doubt that is what it means,” and he looked more supercilious\nthan ever.\n\nThe next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  “This is evidently\na deputation,” said the Rocket; “I will receive them with becoming\ndignity” so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if\nhe were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no\nnotice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them\ncaught sight of him.  “Hallo!” he cried, “what a bad rocket!” and he\nthrew him over the wall into the ditch.\n\n“BAD Rocket?  BAD Rocket?” he said, as he whirled through the air;\n“impossible!  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.  BAD and GRAND\nsound very much the same, indeed they often are the same”; and he fell\ninto the mud.\n\n“It is not comfortable here,” he remarked, “but no doubt it is some\nfashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my\nhealth.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require\nrest.”\n\nThen a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat,\nswam up to him.\n\n“A new arrival, I see!” said the Frog.  “Well, after all there is nothing\nlike mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do\nyou think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky\nis quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket, and he began to cough.\n\n“What a delightful voice you have!” cried the Frog.  “Really it is quite\nlike a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the\nworld.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck\npond close by the farmer’s house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.\nIt is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact,\nit was only yesterday that I heard the farmer’s wife say to her mother\nthat she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is\nmost gratifying to find oneself so popular.”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he\ncould not get a word in.\n\n“A delightful voice, certainly,” continued the Frog; “I hope you will\ncome over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have\nsix beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He\nis a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off\nthem.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I\nassure you.”\n\n“Conversation, indeed!” said the Rocket.  “You have talked the whole time\nyourself.  That is not conversation.”\n\n“Somebody must listen,” answered the Frog, “and I like to do all the\ntalking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.”\n\n“But I like arguments,” said the Rocket.\n\n“I hope not,” said the Frog complacently.  “Arguments are extremely\nvulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.\nGood-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little\nFrog swam away.\n\n“You are a very irritating person,” said the Rocket, “and very ill-bred.\nI hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to\ntalk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and\nselfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my\ntemperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you\nshould take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.\nNow that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I\nam going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at\nCourt; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my\nhonour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a\nprovincial.”\n\n“There is no good talking to him,” said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on\nthe top of a large brown bulrush; “no good at all, for he has gone away.”\n\n“Well, that is his loss, not mine,” answered the Rocket.  “I am not going\nto stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like\nhearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have\nlong conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I\ndon’t understand a single word of what I am saying.”\n\n“Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,” said the Dragon-fly;\nand he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.\n\n“How very silly of him not to stay here!” said the Rocket.  “I am sure\nthat he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However,\nI don’t care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some\nday”; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.\n\nAfter some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs,\nand webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her\nwaddle.\n\n“Quack, quack, quack,” she said.  “What a curious shape you are!  May I\nask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?”\n\n“It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,” answered\nthe Rocket, “otherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your\nignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable\nas oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up\ninto the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.”\n\n“I don’t think much of that,” said the Duck, “as I cannot see what use it\nis to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw\na cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that\nwould be something.”\n\n“My good creature,” cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, “I\nsee that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is\nnever useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than\nsufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least\nof all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have\nalways been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who\nhave nothing whatever to do.”\n\n“Well, well,” said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and\nnever quarrelled with any one, “everybody has different tastes.  I hope,\nat any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.”\n\n“Oh! dear no,” cried the Rocket.  “I am merely a visitor, a distinguished\nvisitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is\nneither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban.\nI shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make\na sensation in the world.”\n\n“I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,” remarked the Duck;\n“there are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair\nat a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning\neverything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much\neffect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.”\n\n“I am made for public life,” said the Rocket, “and so are all my\nrelations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great\nattention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will\nbe a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and\ndistracts one’s mind from higher things.”\n\n“Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!” said the Duck; “and\nthat reminds me how hungry I feel”: and she swam away down the stream,\nsaying, “Quack, quack, quack.”\n\n“Come back! come back!” screamed the Rocket, “I have a great deal to say\nto you”; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  “I am glad that she has\ngone,” he said to himself, “she has a decidedly middle-class mind”; and\nhe sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the\nloneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came\nrunning down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.\n\n“This must be the deputation,” said the Rocket, and he tried to look very\ndignified.\n\n“Hallo!” cried one of the boys, “look at this old stick!  I wonder how it\ncame here”; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.\n\n“OLD Stick!” said the Rocket, “impossible!  GOLD Stick, that is what he\nsaid.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one\nof the Court dignitaries!”\n\n“Let us put it into the fire!” said the other boy, “it will help to boil\nthe kettle.”\n\nSo they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit\nthe fire.\n\n“This is magnificent,” cried the Rocket, “they are going to let me off in\nbroad day-light, so that every one can see me.”\n\n“We will go to sleep now,” they said, “and when we wake up the kettle\nwill be boiled”; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.\n\nThe Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last,\nhowever, the fire caught him.\n\n“Now I am going off!” he cried, and he made himself very stiff and\nstraight.  “I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher\nthan the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high\nthat—”\n\nFizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.\n\n“Delightful!” he cried, “I shall go on like this for ever.  What a\nsuccess I am!”\n\nBut nobody saw him.\n\nThen he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.\n\n“Now I am going to explode,” he cried.  “I shall set the whole world on\nfire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for\na whole year.”  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the\ngunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.\n\nBut nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound\nasleep.\n\nThen all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the\nback of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.\n\n“Good heavens!” cried the Goose.  “It is going to rain sticks”; and she\nrushed into the water.\n\n“I knew I should create a great sensation,” gasped the Rocket, and he\nwent out.\n\n","Article 2001: The Free Trade Commission\n1.

Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. Bing!\nDoug!!\nHmm.\nI’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.\nOh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!\nNo, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.\nOh?\nOh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.\nWell, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You’re okay.\nOkay.\nHa! Ahhhhhhh!\nAhhhhh!\nOkay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?\nOh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.\nNo! No! Look at that! It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!\nPhoebe!\nRight, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.\nCome on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...\nOh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.\nOhh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.\nYou said it was okay!\nYou said she was bald!!\nWhat?! What-what-what-what-what?!!\nPhoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!\nOkay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?\nYes.\nWell isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?\nYes.\nSo?\nI just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!\nOh no.\nWhat?\nOh, we killed them all.\nOh!\nIt’s okay, it’s not as bad as it looks, it’s a precaution. Ah, I’m not supposed to move my spine.\nPlease tell me you’re stopping now.\nI’m fine! I’d fight tonight, if they’d let me. See this circle I’m marking off here? This is my zone of terror.\nYou are insane! You-you gotta give this up!\nI can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I’m telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.\nSit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!\nY'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt.\nWell then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me.\nWell if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to be someone I’m not. I’ve got to do this.\nThen I’ve gotta go. Bye.\nMon-Monica?\nYes?\nCould you leave a note? ‘Cause I’m on a lot of pain killers now, and I don’t know if I’ll remember this tomorrow.\nSo, in conclusion, the lines all go up\nThank you, sir.\nOh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.\nOf course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You’re not feeling left out or anything are ya?\nNo. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.\nEverybody else got one, and you want one too. Don’t you?\nYe-ye-yeah, yes I do!\nNow get on out of here, you!\nPete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...\nRun! Run you crazy, rich freak!\nOh, I can’t watch this.\nCheck it out, he’s winning! Pete’s winning!\nReally?!\nNo-o-o!!\nUh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.\nOh! Oh!\nWait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?\nWell, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t.\nOhh!!\n","Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the 103d Congress, my fellow Americans:\nI'm not at all sure what speech is in the TelePrompter tonight—[laughter]—but I hope we can talk about the state of the Union.\nI ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided over this Chamber with such force and grace. Tip O'Neill liked to call himself \"a man of the House.\" And he surely was that. But even more, he was a man of the people, a bricklayer's son who helped to build the great American middle class. Tip O'Neill never forgot who he was, where he came from, or who sent him here. Tonight he's smiling down on us for the first time from the Lord's gallery. But in his honor, may we, too, always remember who we are, where we come from, and who sent us here. If we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if we simply give ordinary people equal opportunity, quality education, and a fair shot at the American dream, they will do extraordinary things.\nWe gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all nations are tested. Our American heritage has always been to master such change, to use it to expand opportunity at home and our leadership abroad. But for too long and in too many ways, that heritage was abandoned, and our country drifted.\nFor 30 years, family life in America has been breaking down. For 20 years, the wages of working people have been stagnant or declining. For the 12 years of trickle-down economics, we built a false prosperity on a hollow base as our national debt quadrupled. From 1989 to 1992, we experienced the slowest growth in a half century. For too many families, even when both parents were working, the American dream has been slipping away.\nIn 1992, the American people demanded that we change. A year ago I asked all of you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of our country. Well, we did. We replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform. And I want to thank every one of you here who heard the American people, who broke gridlock, who gave them the most successful teamwork between a President and a Congress in 30 years.\nThis Congress produced a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion dollars, cut spending, and raised income taxes on only the wealthiest Americans. This Congress produced tax relief for millions of low-income workers to reward work over welfare. It produced NAFTA. It produced the Brady bill, now the Brady law. And thank you, Jim Brady, for being here, and God bless you, sir.\nThis Congress produced tax cuts to reduce the taxes of 9 out of 10 small businesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs. It produced more research and treatment for AIDS, more childhood immunizations, more support for women's health research, more affordable college loans for the middle class, a new national service program for those who want to give something back to their country and their communities for higher education, a dramatic increase in high-tech investments to move us from a defense to a domestic high-tech economy. This Congress produced a new law, the motor voter bill, to help millions of people register to vote. It produced family and medical leave. All passed. All signed into law with not one single veto. These accomplishments were all commitments I made when I sought this office. And in fairness, they all had to be passed by you in this Congress. But I am persuaded that the real credit belongs to the people who sent us here, who pay our salaries, who hold our feet to the fre.\nBut what we do here is really beginning to change lives. Let me just give you one example. I will never forget what the family and medical leave law meant to just one father I met early one Sunday morning in the White House. It was unusual to see a family there touring early Sunday morning, but he had his wife and his three children there, one of them in a wheelchair. I came up, and after we had our picture taken and had a little visit, I was walking off and that man grabbed me by the arm and he said, \"Mr. President, let me tell you something. My little girl here is desperately ill. She's probably not going to make it. But because of the family leave law, I was able to take time off to spend with her, the most important time I ever spent in my life, without losing my job and hurting the rest of my family. It means more to me than I will ever be able to say. Don't you people up here ever think what you do doesn't make a difference. It does.\"\nThough we are making a difference, our work has just begun. Many Americans still haven't felt the impact of what we've done. The recovery still hasn't touched every community or created enough jobs. Incomes are still stagnant. There's still too much violence and not enough hope in too many places. Abroad, the young democracies we are strongly supporting still face very difficult times and look to us for leadership. And so tonight, let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal, to create more and better jobs, to guarantee health security for all, to reward work over welfare, to promote democracy abroad, and to begin to reclaim our streets from violent crime and drugs and gangs, to renew our own American community.\nLast year we began to put our house in order by tackling the budget deficit that was driving us toward bankruptcy. We cut $255 billion in spending, including entitlements, and over 340 separate budget items. We froze domestic spending and used honest budget numbers.\nLed by the Vice President, we launched a campaign to reinvent Government. We cut staff, cut perks, even trimmed the fleet of Federal limousines. After years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked bureaucracy but whose action expanded it, we will actually reduce it by 252,000 people over the next 5 years. By the time we have finished, the Federal bureaucracy will be at its lowest point in 30 years.\nBecause the deficit was so large and because they benefited from tax cuts in the 1980's, we did ask the wealthiest Americans to pay more to reduce the deficit. So on April the 15th, the American people will discover the truth about what we did last year on taxes. Only the top 1yes, listen, the top 1.2 percent of Americans, as I said all along, will pay higher income tax rates. Let me repeat: Only the wealthiest 1.2 percent of Americans will face higher income tax rates, and no one else will. And that is the truth.\nOf course, there were, as there always are in politics, naysayers who said this plan wouldn't work. But they were wrong. When I became President, the experts predicted that next year's deficit would be $300 billion. But because we acted, those same people now say the deficit is going to be under $180 billion, 40 percent lower than was previously predicted.\nOur economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation rate and the lowest interest rates in 20 years. And because those interest rates are down, business investment and equipment is growing at 7 times the rate of the previous 4 years. Auto sales are way up. Home sales are at a record high. Millions of Americans have refinanced their homes, and our economy has produced 1.6 million private sector jobs in 1993, more than were created in the previous 4 years combined.\nThe people who supported this economic plan should be proud of its early results. Proud. But everyone in this Chamber should know and acknowledge that there is more to do.\nNext month I will send you one of the toughest budgets ever presented to Congress. It will cut spending in more than 300 programs, eliminate 100 domestic programs, and reform the ways in which governments buy goods and services. This year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard spending ceilings we have set. We must do it. We have proved we can bring the deficit down without choking off recovery, without punishing seniors or the middle class, and without putting our national security at risk. If you will stick with this plan, we will post 3 consecutive years of declining deficits for the first time since Harry Truman lived in the White House. And once again, the buck stops here.\nOur economic plan also bolsters our strength and our credibility around the world. Once we reduced the deficit and put the steel back into our competitive edge, the world echoed with the sound of falling trade barriers. In one year, with NAFTA, with GATT, with our efforts in Asia and the National Export Strategy, we did more to open world markets to American products than at any time in the last two generations. That means more jobs and rising living standards for the American people, low deficits, low inflation, low interest rates, low trade barriers, and high investments. These are the building blocks of our recovery. But if we want to take full advantage of the opportunities before us in the global economy, you all know we must do more.\nAs we reduce defense spending, I ask Congress to invest more in the technologies of tomorrow. Defense conversion will keep us strong militarily and create jobs for our people here at home. As we protect our environment, we must invest in the environmental technologies of the future which will create jobs. This year we will fight for a revitalized Clean Water Act and a Safe Drinking Water Act and a reformed Superfund program. And the Vice President is right, we must also work with the private sector to connect every classroom, every clinic, every library, every hospital in America into a national information super highway by the year 2000.\nThink of it, instant access to information will increase productivity, will help to educate our children. It will provide better medical care. It will create jobs. And I call on the Congress to pass legislation to establish that information super highway this year.\nAs we expand opportunity and create jobs, no one can be left out. We must continue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil rights laws, because America will never be complete in its renewal until everyone shares in its bounty.\nBut we all know, too, we can do all these things, put our economic house in order, expand world trade, target the jobs of the future, guarantee equal opportunity, but if we're honest, we'll all admit that this strategy still cannot work unless we also give our people the education, training, and skills they need to seize the opportunities of tomorrow.\nWe must set tough, world-class academic and occupational standards for all our children and give our teachers and students the tools they need to meet them. Our Goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to experiment with ideas like chartering their schools to be run by private corporations or having more public school choice, to do whatever they wish to do as long as we measure every school by one high standard: Are our children learning what they need to know to compete and win in the global economy? Goals 2000 links world-class standards to grassroots reforms. And I hope Congress will pass it without delay.\nOur school to work initiative will for the first time link school to the world of work, providing at least one year of apprenticeship beyond high school. After all, most of the people we're counting on to build our economic future won't graduate from college. It's time to stop ignoring them and start empowering them.\nWe must literally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new reemployment system. The old unemployment system just sort of kept you going while you waited for your old job to come back. We've got to have a new system to move people into new and better jobs, because most of those old jobs just don't come back. And we know that the only way to have real job security in the future, to get a good job with a growing income, is to have real skills and the ability to learn new ones. So we've got to streamline today's patchwork of training programs and make them a source of new skills for our people who lose their jobs. Reemployment, not unemployment, must become the centerpiece of our economic renewal. I urge you to pass it in this session of Congress.\nAnd just as we must transform our unemployment system, so must we also revolutionize our welfare system. It doesn't work. It defies our values as a Nation. If we value work, we can't justify a system that makes welfare more attractive than work if people are worried about losing their health care. If we value responsibility, we can't ignore the $34 billion in child support absent parents ought to be paying to millions of parents who are taking care of their children. If we value strong families, we can't perpetuate a system that actually penalizes those who stay together. Can you believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the Government for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a grandparent? That's not just bad policy, it's wrong. And we ought to change it.\nI worked on this problem for years before I became President, with other Governors and with Members of Congress of both parties and with the previous administration of another party. I worked on it with people who were on welfare, lots of them. And I want to say something to everybody here who cares about this issue. The people who most want to change this system are the people who are dependent on it. They want to get off welfare. They want to go back to work. They want to do right by their kids.\nI once had a hearing when I was a Governor, and I brought in people on welfare from all over America who had found their way to work. The woman from my State who testified was asked this question: What's the best thing about being off welfare and in a job? And without blinking an eye, she looked at 40 Governors, and she said, \"When my boy goes to school and they say what does you mother do for a living, he can give an answer.\" These people want a better system, and we ought to give it to them.\nLast year we began this. We gave the States more power to innovate because we know that a lot of great ideas come from outside Washington, and many States are already using it. Then this Congress took a dramatic step. Instead of taxing people with modest incomes into poverty, we helped them to work their way out of poverty by dramatically increasing the earned-income tax credit. It will lift 15 million working families out of poverty, rewarding work over welfare, making it possible for people to be successful workers and successful parents. Now that's real welfare reform.\nBut there is more to be done. This spring I will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that builds on the Family Support Act of 1988 and restores the basic values of work and responsibility. We'll say to teenagers, \"If you have a child out of wedlock, we will no longer give you a check to set up a separate household. We want families to stay together;\" say to absent parents who aren't paying their child support, \"If you're not providing for your children, we'll garnish your wages, suspend your license, track you across State lines, and if necessary, make some of you work off what you owe.\" People who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away from them. But to all those who depend on welfare, we should offer ultimately a simple compact. We'll provide the support, the job training, the child care you need for up to 2 years. But after that, anyone who can work, must, in the private sector wherever possible, in community service, if necessary. That's the only way we'll ever make welfare what it ought to be, a second chance, not a way of life.\nI know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same time we tackle health care. But let me point out, I think it is inevitable and imperative. It is estimated that one million people are on welfare today because it's the only way they can get health care coverage for their children. Those who choose to leave welfare for jobs without health benefits, and many entry-level jobs don't have health benefits, find themselves in the incredible position of paying taxes that help to pay for health care coverage for those who made the other choice to stay on welfare. No wonder people leave work and go back to welfare to get health care coverage. We've got to solve the health care problem to have real welfare reform.\nSo this year, we will make history by reforming the health care system. And I would say to you, all of you, my fellow public servants, this is another issue where the people are way ahead of the politicians. That may not be popular with either party, but it happens to be the truth.\nYou know, the First Lady has received now almost a million letters from people all across America and from all walks of life. I'd like to share just one of them with you. Richard Anderson of Reno, Nevada, lost his job and with it, his health insurance. Two weeks later his wife, Judy, suffered a cerebral aneurysm. He rushed her to the hospital, where she stayed in intensive care for 21 days. The Andersons' bills were over $120,000. Although Judy recovered and Richard went back to work at $8 an hour, the bills were too much for them, and they were literally forced into bankruptcy. \"Mrs. Clinton,\" he wrote to Hillary, \"no one in the United States of America should have to lose everything they've worked for all their lives because they were unfortunate enough to become ill.\" It was to help the Richard and Judy Andersons of America that the First Lady and so many others have worked so hard and so long on this health care reform issue. We owe them our thanks and our action.\nI know there are people here who say there's no health care crisis. Tell it to Richard and Judy Anderson. Tell it to the 58 million Americans who have no coverage at all for some time each year. Tell it to the 81 million Americans with those preexisting conditions. Those folks are paying more, or they can't get insurance at all. Or they can't ever change their jobs because they or someone in their family has one of those preexisting conditions. Tell it to the small businesses burdened by the skyrocketing cost of insurance. Most small businesses cover their employees, and they pay on average 35 percent more in premiums than big businesses or Government. Or tell it to the 76 percent of insured Americans, three out of four whose policies have lifetime limits. And that means they can find themselves without any coverage at all just when they need it the most. So if any of you believe there's no crisis, you tell it to those people, because I can't.\nThere are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this problem on people's lives. And all you have to do is go out and listen to them. Just go talk to them anywhere in any congressional district in this country. They're Republicans and Democrats and independents; it doesn't have a lick to do with party. They think we don't get it. And it's time we show them that we do get it.\nFrom the day we began, our health care initiative has been designed to strengthen what is good about our health care system: the world's best health care professionals, cutting-edge research and wonderful research institutions, Medicare for older Americans. None of this, none of it should be put at risk.\nBut we're paying more and more money for less and less care. Every year fewer and fewer Americans even get to choose their doctors. Every year doctors and nurses spend more time on paperwork and less time with patients because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the present system has become. This system is riddled with inefficiency, with abuse, with fraud, and everybody knows it. In today's health care system, insurance companies call the shots. They pick whom they cover and how they cover them. They can cut off your benefits when you need your coverage the most. They are in charge.\nWhat does it mean? It means every night millions of well-insured Americans go to bed just an illness, an accident, or a pink slip away from having no coverage or financial ruin. It means every morning millions of Americans go to work without any health insurance at all, something the workers in no other advanced country in the world do. It means that every year, more and more hard-working people are told to pick a new doctor because their boss has had to pick a new plan. And countless others turn down better jobs because they know if they take the better job, they will lose their health insurance. If we just let the health care system continue to drift, our country will have people with less care, fewer choices, and higher bills.\nNow, our approach protects the quality of care and people's choices. It builds on what works today in the private sector, to expand employer-based coverage, to guarantee private insurance for every American. And I might say, employer-based private insurance for every American was proposed 20 years ago by President Richard Nixon to the United States Congress. It was a good idea then, and it's a better idea today.\nWhy do we want guaranteed private insurance? Because right now 9 out of 10 people who have insurance get it through their employers. And that should continue. And if your employer is providing good benefits at reasonable prices, that should continue, too. That ought to make the Congress and the President feel better.\nOur goal is health insurance everybody can depend on: comprehensive benefits that cover preventive care and prescription drugs; health premiums that don't just explode when you get sick or you get older; the power, no matter how small your business is, to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rates governments and big business get today; one simple form for people who are sick; and most of all, the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor.\nOur approach protects older Americans. Every plan before the Congress proposes to slow the growth of Medicare. The difference is this: We believe those savings should be used to improve health care for senior citizens. Medicare must be protected, and it should cover prescription drugs, and we should take the first steps in covering long-term care. To those who would cut Medicare without protecting seniors, I say the solution to today's squeeze on middle-class working people's health care is not to put the squeeze on middle-class retired people's health care. We can do better than that.\nWhen it's all said and done, it's pretty simple to me. Insurance ought to mean what it used to mean: You pay a fair price for security, and when you get sick, health care's always there, no matter what.\nAlong with the guarantee of health security, we all have to admit, too, there must be more responsibility on the part of all of us in how we use this system. People have to take their kids to get immunized. We should all take advantage of preventive care. We must all work together to stop the violence that explodes our emergency rooms. We have to practice better health habits, and we can't abuse the system. And those who don't have insurance under our approach will get coverage, but they'll have to pay something for it, too. The minority of businesses that provide no insurance at all and in so doing shift the cost of the care of their employees to others, should contribute something. People who smoke should pay more for a pack of cigarettes. Everybody can contribute something if we want to solve the health care crisis. There can't be any more something for nothing. It will not be easy but it can be done.\nNow, in the coming months I hope very much to work with both Democrats and Republicans to reform a health care system by using the market to bring down costs and to achieve lasting health security. But if you look at history we see that for 60 years this country has tried to reform health care. President Roosevelt tried. President Truman tried. President Nixon tried. President Carter tried. Every time the special interests were powerful enough to defeat them. But not this time.\nI know that facing up to these interests will require courage. It will raise critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how lobbyists yield their influence. The work of change, frankly, will never get any easier until we limit the influence of well-financed interests who profit from this current system. So I also must now call on you to finish the job both Houses began last year by passing tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year.\nYou know, my fellow Americans, this is really a test for all of us. The American people provide those of us in Government service with terrific health care benefits at reasonable costs. We have health care that's always there. I think we need to give every hard-working, tax-paying American the same health care security they have already given to us.\nI want to make this very clear. I am open, as I have said repeatedly, to the best ideas of concerned Members of both parties. I have no special brief for any specific approach, even in our own bill, except this: If you send me legislation that does not guarantee every American private health insurance that can never be taken away, you will force me to take this pen, veto the legislation, and we'll come right back here and start all over again.\nBut I don't think that's going to happen. I think we're ready to act now. I believe that you're ready to act now. And if you're ready to guarantee every American the same health care that you have, health care that can never be taken away, now, not next year or the year after, now is the time to stand with the people who sent us here. Now.\nAs we take these steps together to renew our strength at home, we cannot turn away from our obligation to renew our leadership abroad. This is a promising moment. Because of the agreements we have reached this year, last year, Russia's strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be pointed at the United States, nor will we point ours at them. Instead of building weapons in space, Russian scientists will help us to build the international space station.\nOf course, there are still dangers in the world: rampant arms proliferation, bitter regional conflicts, ethnic and nationalist tensions in many new democracies, severe environmental degradation the world over, and fanatics who seek to cripple the world's cities with terror. As the world's greatest power, we must, therefore, maintain our defenses and our responsibilities.\nThis year, we secured indictments against terrorists and sanctions against those who harbor them. We worked to promote environmentally sustainable economic growth. We achieved agreements with Ukraine, with Belarus, with Kazakhstan to eliminate completely their nuclear arsenal. We are working to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons. We will seek early ratification of a treaty to ban chemical weapons worldwide. And earlier today, we joined with over 30 nations to begin negotiations on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear testing.\nBut nothing, nothing is more important to our security than our Nation's Armed Forces. We honor their contributions, including those who are carrying out the longest humanitarian air lift in history in Bosnia, those who will complete their mission in Somalia this year and their brave comrades who gave their lives there. Our forces are the finest military our Nation has ever had. And I have pledged that as long as I am President, they will remain the best equipped, the best trained, and the best prepared fighting force on the face of the Earth.\nLast year I proposed a defense plan that maintains our post-cold-war security at a lower cost. This year many people urged me to cut our defense spending further to pay for other Government programs. I said, no. The budget I send to Congress draws the line against further defense cuts. It protects the readiness and quality of our forces. Ultimately, the best strategy is to do that. We must not cut defense further. I hope the Congress, without regard to party, will support that position.\nUltimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack each other, they make better trading partners and partners in diplomacy. That is why we have supported, you and I, the democratic reformers in Russia and in the other states of the former Soviet bloc. I applaud the bipartisan support this Congress provided last year for our initiatives to help Russia, Ukraine, and the other states through their epic transformations.\nOur support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and vigilance for our fundamental interest and values. We will continue to urge Russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms. And we will seek to cooperate with Russia to solve regional problems, while insisting that if Russian troops operate in neighboring states, they do so only when those states agree to their presence and in strict accord with international standards.\nBut we must also remember as these nations chart their own futures—and they must chart their own futures—how much more secure and more prosperous our own people will be if democratic and market reforms succeed all across the former Communist bloc. Our policy has been to support that move, and that has been the policy of the Congress. We should continue it.\nThat is why I went to Europe earlier this month, to work with our European partners, to help to integrate all the former Communist countries into a Europe that has a possibility of becoming unified for the first time in its entire history, its entire history, based on the simple commitments of all nations in Europe to democracy, to free markets, and to respect for existing borders.\nWith our allies we have created a Partnership For Peace that invites states from the former Soviet bloc and other non-NATO members to work with NATO in military cooperation. When I met with Central Europe's leaders, including Lech Walesa and Vбclav Havel, men who put their lives on the line for freedom, I told them that the security of their region is important to our country's security.\nThis year we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human rights and sustainable development all around the world. We will ask Congress to ratify the new GATT accord. We will continue standing by South Africa as it works its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult transition to democracy. We will convene a summit of the Western Hemisphere's democratic leaders from Canada to the tip of South America. And we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in Haiti. And as we build a more constructive relationship with China, we must continue to insist on clear signs of improvement in that nation's human rights record.\nWe will also work for new progress toward the Middle East peace. Last year the world watched Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat at the White House when they had their historic handshake of reconciliation. But there is a long, hard road ahead. And on that road I am determined that I and our administration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for all the peoples of the region.\nNow, there are some in our country who argue that with the cold war, America should turn its back on the rest of the world. Many around the world were afraid we would do just that. But I took this office on a pledge that had no partisan tinge, to keep our Nation secure by remaining engaged in the rest of the world. And this year, because of our work together, enacting NAFTA, keeping our military strong and prepared, supporting democracy abroad, we have reaffirmed America's leadership, America's engagement. And as a result, the American people are more secure than they were before.\nBut while Americans are more secure from threats abroad, I think we all know that in many ways we are less secure from threats here at home. Every day the national peace is shattered by crime. In Petaluma, California, an innocent slumber party gives way to agonizing tragedy for the family of Polly Klaas. An ordinary train ride on Long Island ends in a hail of 9-millimeter rounds. A tourist in Florida is nearly burned alive by bigots simply because he is black. Right here in our Nation's Capital, a brave young man named Jason White, a policeman, the son and grandson of policemen, is ruthlessly gunned down. Violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society, limiting personal freedom, and fraying the ties that bind us.\nThe crime bill before Congress gives you a chance to do something about it, a chance to be tough and smart. What does that mean? Let me begin by saying I care a lot about this issue. Many years ago, when I started out in public life, I was the attorney general of my State. I served as a Governor for a dozen years. I know what it's like to sign laws increasing penalties, to build more prison cells, to carry out the death penalty. I understand this issue. And it is not a simple thing.\nFirst, we must recognize that most violent crimes are committed by a small percentage of criminals who too often break the laws even when they are on parole. Now those who commit crimes should be punished. And those who commit repeated, violent crimes should be told, \"When you commit a third violent crime, you will be put away, and put away for good. Three strikes, and you are out.\"\nSecond, we must take serious steps to reduce violence and prevent crime, beginning with more police officers and more community policing. We know right now that police who work the streets, know the folks, have the respect of the neighborhood kids, focus on high crime areas, we know that they are more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminals. Look at the experience of Houston, where the crime rate dropped 17 percent in one year when that approach was taken.\nHere tonight is one of those community policemen, a brave, young detective, Kevin Jett, whose beat is eight square blocks in one of the toughest neighborhoods in New York. Every day he restores some sanity and safety and a sense of values and connections to the people whose lives he protects. I'd like to ask him to stand up and be recognized tonight. Thank you, sir.\nYou will be given a chance to give the children of this country, the law-abiding working people of this country—and don't forget, in the toughest neighborhoods in this country, in the highest crime neighborhoods in this country, the vast majority of people get up every day and obey the law, pay their taxes, do their best to raise their kids. They deserve people like Kevin Jett. And you're going to be given a chance to give the American people another 100,000 of them, well trained. And I urge you to do it.\nYou have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police corps to encourage young people to get an education and pay it off by serving as police officers; which encourages retiring military personnel to move into police forces, an inordinate resource for our country; one which has a safe schools provision which will give our young people the chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodging bullets. These are important things.\nThe third thing we have to do is to build on the Brady bill, the Brady law, to take further steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. I want to say something about this issue. Hunters must always be free to hunt. Law-abiding adults should always be free to own guns and protect their homes. I respect that part of our culture; I grew up in it. But I want to ask the sportsmen and others who lawfully own guns to join us in this campaign to reduce gun violence. I say to you, I know you didn't create this problem, but we need your help to solve it. There is no sporting purpose on Earth that should stop the United States Congress from banishing assault weapons that out-gun police and cut down children.\nFourth, we must remember that drugs are a factor in an enormous percentage of crimes. Recent studies indicate, sadly, that drug use is on the rise again among our young people. The crime bill contains—all the crime bills contain—more money for drug treatment for criminal addicts and boot camps for youthful offenders that include incentives to get off drugs and to stay off drugs. Our administration's budget, with all its cuts, contains a large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education. You must pass them both. We need them desperately.\nMy fellow Americans, the problem of violence is an American problem. It has no partisan or philosophical element. Therefore, I urge you to find ways as quickly as possible to set aside partisan differences and pass a strong, smart, tough crime bill. But further, I urge you to consider this: As you demand tougher penalties for those who choose violence, let us also remember how we came to this sad point. In our toughest neighborhoods, on our meanest streets, in our poorest rural areas, we have seen a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of community, family, and work, the heart and soul of civilized society. This has created a vast vacuum which has been filled by violence and drugs and gangs. So I ask you to remember that even as we say \"no\" to crime, we must give people, especially our young people, something to say \"yes\" to.\nMany of our initiatives, from job training to welfare reform to health care to national service, will help to rebuild distressed communities, to strengthen families, to provide work. But more needs to be done. That's what our community empowerment agenda is all about, challenging businesses to provide more investment through empowerment zones, ensuring banks will make loans in the same communities their deposits come from, passing legislation to unleash the power of capital through community development banks to create jobs, opportunity, and hope where they're needed most.\nI think you know that to really solve this problem, we'll all have to put our heads together, leave our ideological armor aside, and find some new ideas to do even more. And let's be honest, we all know something else too: Our problems go way beyond the reach of Government. They're rooted in the loss of values, in the disappearance of work, and the breakdown of our families and our communities.\nMy fellow Americans, we can cut the deficit, create jobs, promote democracy around the world, pass welfare reform and health care, pass the toughest crime bill in history, but still leave too many of our people behind. The American people have got to want to change from within if we're going to bring back work and family and community. We cannot renew our country when within a decade more than half of the children will be born into families where there has been no marriage. We cannot renew this country when 13-year-old boys get semi-automatic weapons to shoot 9-year-olds for kicks. We can't renew our country when children are having children, and the fathers walk away as if the kids don't amount to anything. We can't renew the country when our businesses eagerly look for new investments and new customers abroad but ignore those people right here at home who would give anything to have their jobs and would gladly buy their products if they had the money to do it. We can't renew our country unless more of usI mean, all of us—are willing to join the churches and the other good citizens, people like all the ministers I've worked with over the years or the priests and the nuns I met at Our Lady of Help in east Los Angeles or my good friend Tony Campollo in Philadelphia, unless we're willing to work with people like that, people who are saving kids, adopting schools, making streets safer. All of us can do that. We can't renew our country until we realize that governments don't raise children, parents do.\nParents who know their children's teachers and turn off the television and help with the homework and teach their kids right from wrong, those kinds of parents can make all the difference. I know, I had one. I'm telling you, we have got to stop pointing our fingers at these kids who have no future and reach our hands out to them. Our country needs it, we need it, and they deserve it.\nSo I say to you tonight, let's give our children a future. Let us take away their guns and give them books. Let us overcome their despair and replace it with hope. Let us, by our example, teach them to obey the law, respect our neighbors, and cherish our values. Let us weave these sturdy threads into a new American community that can once more stand strong against the forces of despair and evil because everybody has a chance to walk into a better tomorrow.\nOh, there will be naysayers who fear that we won't be equal to the challenges of this time. But they misread our history, our heritage. Even today's headlines, all those things tell us we can and we will overcome any challenge.\nWhen the Earth shook and fires raged in California, when I saw the Mississippi deluge the farmlands of the Midwest in a 500-year flood, when the century's bitterest cold swept from North Dakota to Newport News, it seemed as though the world itself was coming apart at the seams. But the American people, they just came together. They rose to the occasion, neighbor helping neighbor, strangers risking life and limb to save total strangers, showing the better angels of our nature.\nLet us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters, leaving our deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting. Let us instead be true to our spirit, facing facts, coming together, bringing hope, and moving forward.\nTonight, my fellow Americans, we are summoned to answer a question as old as the Republic itself: What is the state of our Union? It is growing stronger, but it must be stronger still. With your help, and God's help, it will be.\nThank you, and God bless America.\n","\nWhen me and my friend drove down to meet some friends at a local college, we were not expecting to do any tripping. We had done plenty of weed and X, but neither of us had ever had the connection or the interest to get acid. When we discovered our friends had some acid left over from the night before, (it was a pretty big priority for us to have the LSD tested by a reliable source) we pitched in some money and purchased 8 hits, which were dropped on gummi peaches. We weren't spending the night, and drove home to make the midnight curfew my mom had imposed on us.\n\nWhen we were about 30 minutes from home, we decided to go ahead and each take 2 of our 4 hits, even though we knew we would have to be talking to my mom. Then we hit traffic on the interstate, even though it was 11:00 PM, and I started to get a little uneasy. About 10 minutes from home, and 40 minutes after we first dropped the hits, we both started to giggle. Driving became extremely fun for my friend, who informed me that he would not be able to stop laughing when my mom answered the door.\n\n1 hour after dropping:\nWe stifled laughter as we pushed past my mom into the basement, where we would be spending the night. I quickly ran downstairs and turned on the TV, anxious for my mom to go to bed. I soon realized my friend wasn't behind me. Tracing my steps backwards, I found him sitting in the stairway staring at a mural of some birds.\n'Are you seeing this?' he asked me.\nLooking at the mural to see what he was talking about, I saw the trees begin to sway and the birds take flight. Knowing we were going to be in for a long night, I pulled him down to the couch where we waited for my mom to go to bed.\n\n2 hours after dropping:\nThe state of mind I found myself in was extremely interesting. My friend was repeatedly trying to get me to call another friend to act as 'ground control,' for he explained to me that he would periodically lose all concept of who he was or the situation he was in. I was comfortable with my surroundings, and as I described it to him 'in my element.' I found myself in the bathroom staring in the mirror, my friend was standing beside me but had changed into a completely different person. Staring at his face for a period of about a minute would find him changing into 4 different people, an elf, and a dog. (I find myself still, several months later, able to change his face with some concentration when I am really high)\n\nThe one thing that I cannot stress enough about LSD induced hallucinations is how real they seem. I have seen things with weed before, but never with the detail and clarity which I experienced on acid. The people I saw my friend change into I had never seen before, but each one of them held very distinct features and detail in the face, and when he spoke the words would be spoken by whatever person I was currently seeing. It was truly amazing to me. I then turned to the mirror, and immediately saw my face melt and distort itself into hideous images. Reading through several trip accounts before attempting LSD, I found it fascinating the relative ease and comfort which people viewed these terrifying images they described. Experiencing this first hand, I felt a strange sense of safety while seeing this, knowing that I was on acid and this was all part of the experience. Having said this, I can easily see how bad trips develop and cannot stress the importance of knowing what you are getting into and being in a comfortable environment. (ie. your basement)\n\nAs I continued to look into the mirror I became unable to distinguish which side of the mirror I was on, and felt as though I was inside looking out. As I placed my head against the mirror and stared into my own eyes, I would shift in and out of the correct side of the mirror, momentarily losing grip on reality.\n\n3.5 hours after dropping:\nThe decision to go outside was made out of sheer wonder and curiosity. Seeming to have the opposite effect of weed, the acid seemed to OVER calm our fears so that we were not neccesarily as careful as we probably should have been. Nevertheless, after a very interesting walk we ended up in the middle of my cul-de-sac. Light was everywhere. The whole cul-de-sac was illuminated in red, blue, and white light. We continually thought we saw headlights, but instead of running or hiding we stared awestruck. As my friend described how the cement had transformed itself into a Roman tiling, I witnessed a very different scene. The cul-de-sac had appeared to be the scene of an earthquake, the ground had wide cracks and the car parked in front of my house seemed to be sinking into the ground. Reality was not a concern of mine, and we did not contemplate at the time how strange we must of looked standing in the middle of the cul-de-sac staring at things. We remained outside for a couple of hours, as thoughts and emotions raced through our head only to be gone and forgotten a couple of seconds later.\n\nAfter we had our fill, we began to walk back to the basement. The walk back was probably the only part of the trip that bordered on frightening, because with each step the door seemed to get farther away and once we arrived the entrance to the basement seemed very ominous.\n\n6.5 hours after dropping:\nWe sat down and watched a little TV, and had a great time laughing at the visions we shared of people protruding from the television set. About 7.5 or 8 hours since we began, we could feel reality coming back to us. I first began to sense it in that I began to smell and taste the real world. It is difficult to describe, but just the taste of my mouth and the normal smells of my house were things that had become lost during the trip, and were now beginning to ground me. I went upstairs fearing the sleeplessness (I had to work the next morning), but found myself able to sleep within 30 minutes) The next day at work found me 'not quite there,' but everything did seem a little brighter.\n\nLSD did not provide the euphoria that MDMA does, so if you are looking to FEEL amazing it may not be for you. However, it does make for a great 8 hour adventure. \n\n","\nApart from the occasional caffeine (which has little effect on me) and a few half-glasses of champagne at various special events, and some demerol in hospitals on two occasions, I had no experience with psychoactives prior to trying LSD. Stimulants and depressants are simply not appealing to me and opiates are far too risky. As long as I have known about them (probably since one of those 'Just Say No' lectures that public schools were constantly having in the 80s) LSD (and by extension all psychedelics) have been intriguing to me. I vaguely remember at some point in 8th or 9th grade thinking 'if only LSD did not cause brain damage it would be the perfect drug, and even I would try it'.\n\nRoll the clock forward about 10 years. I have recently started reading Hunter Thompson and listening to an increasing amount of psychedelic music (both 1st generation stuff and newer things like the Butthole Surfers and the Cramps). Naturally, I sought out information on these fascinating substances which had inspired so much great music and literature. Before long, I had learned that, while certainly not 'safe' (what is?), the risks of LSD were almost entirely of the psychological nature. The point is, between the time at which I decided I was going to try LSD and the time I actually tried it I spent about 7 months researching and generally preparing myself mentally for it. This definitely payed off... when I later described some of the most impressive moments of the trip to my friend who acted as guide (and who has had a lot of experience, having taken acid a few hundred times), she was suprised that I had enjoyed it at all. I loved it, paranoia, loss of self, loss of linear time and all. I was not anxious to try it again immediately, but I will almost certainly use it again in the future; I could easily see myself using it once or twice a year indefinitely.\n\nThe experience itself:\n\nI arrived the day before and slept on the couch. the next morning I awoke around 10 and took a long shower, followed by a light breakfast (I cannot remember precisely what). We sat and talked for a little while with her boyfriend, then got the acid from te refrigerator and divided it up. It was difficult to tell how much I took because we only had leftover edges from a sheet, but in retrospect it is clear that she had a prett good idea of how much was actually there. At any rate, I had about four pieces; she had two. After eating it (I swallowed the paper after a minute or so, which her boyriend then warned me not to do - it made his stomach upset...) her boyfriend left for work and we sat and talked aout nothing in particular, looked at some Maurice Sendak books, and waited. And waited. After about 20 minutes I was just beginning to feel it. Nothing was actually different, but there was an increasing sense of anticipation: SOMETHING was about to happen. We moved to the living room and put on some music. Some buddhist chants she had downloaded a few weeks before... nice background music, though somewhat humorous on a meta level: here we are, full of acid listening to buddhist chants in her living room. I found the idea of that strangely amusing. Something was happening, all right.\n\nI guess it took about an hour before it really kicked in, but I can't be sure. I tend to be kind of analytical, so she had hidden all of the clocks in the house beforehand and I had placed my watch safely out of reach. The wait was definitely on the long side, though. Then, without much warning, I could feel it starting to pick up: sort of waves of electricity traveling up my body. She was obviously farther along than I, and asked if I wanted more or not (we had previously discussed whether to go for a lot right off or do a bit at a time so I didn't get more than I felt comfortable with; it ended up being somewhere in between, as my initial dose was probably about the same as an average tab). I said 'sure' and she went to the kitchen to get it. I stood up and took a few steps toward the wall. All of a sudden, everything started to twist into a sort of counterclockwise nautilus spiral, which was centered somewhere above and to the left of my head. This was not visual (though there was initially a slight, brief distortion); it was only a nearly overpowering feeling. I looked at the prints and drawings that were hanging on the wall and thought something along the lines of 'I am HERE. This is it.' About this time, she returned with three more pieces which I put in my mouth and sucked on for maybe five minutes. I had not tasted anything from the first dose I took (which I attribute to the fact that I held it for about five minutes before taking it and my palms were slightly sweaty), but this one had a definite flavor. Despite her boyfriend's assertion that it tasted unpleasant, I enjoyed it. Interestingly enough, it tasted a bit like the acid (of a very different type) that dentists use to soften a tooth before filling it - a taste most people probably dislike.\n\nNow that we were fully taking off, I soon remembered that we had planned on drawing. We got out crayons and paper and made a 'book', which took somewhere between 15 minutes and an hour. When we were tired of drawing, we sat for a few minutes on the floor and did not do much of anything. Neither of us were having any significant visuals. Light seemed a little brighter and more 'pure' and sometimes moved on its own. Distances were distorted. There were no heavy colors or patterns, however, and nothing was significantly distorted. That is not to say that the trip was at all mild up to this point, however. It was simply not going on in the visual domain. Most of the changes were in perception, thought processes, and so forth. Very subjective, very hard to put into words. And, while I did not SEE any distortions or trails or the like, I certainly FELT them.\n\nWe were still sitting on the floor comparing notes when suddenly I snapped back to normalcy. It was almost instant and almost complete. Here I was sitting on the floor, perfectly sober. And there was the couch over there, a few feet away. I suddenly know that I had to get over there quickly while I still had the chance. I muttered something to that effect and stood up, stepped across the floor (only one step... but what a step it was) and dropped onto the couch.\n\n...ceiling, acoustic tiling. Tunneling upward.... the second dose must be kicking in...\n\n...\n\n'I... I think I might be a while... if you... want to read a book or something...'\n\n... picture on the wall is... alive... shapes crawling into themselves...\n\nI am siting on the couch. It is a bit darker outside than it was last time I noticed. Everything around me is still more or less solid, but it seems very distant. The computer is on, and some of the colors are leaking off of the screen onto the side of the monitor, but the picture itself is the only thing in the room that seems to be completely noral. Strange.\n\nI am looking across the room. I do not know how long I have been here. I can feel my body and the couch flowing into each other, a strangely comforting sensation. I am alone in the room, but I know that someone is in the other room, and will be back soon. Or is that me? Am I really just a reflection of what I am looking at? I can feel my presence start to leak out into the couch, like water from a plastic bottle with a leak in the bottom. The level of my existance is falling down my body; only my eyes and teeth are left. Just before everything else disappears completely into the couch, I remember reading 'The Psychedelic Experience' earlier that week, and recognize that this is, in its eccentric way, the 'pure whit elight' that Leary was talking about. Thinking this makes me quickly flow back up out of the couch into myself, much to my chagrin. I suppose that the act of thinking reminded me that I exist. I begin to flow out again, but it does not go much lower than my chest, and I end up laying back on the couch and just enjoying being around.\n\nHow long has it been since then? Minutes? Hours? Someone says something to me and a large stuffed bee attached to a keychain lands on my chest and looks at me. I look back. It is a friendly bee. I like it.\n\nIt is definitely nighttime now; the windows are dark. We have been playing Atari 2600 games on the computer for some time now. Or rather, I have been watching her play. I occasionally try to control the action a bit, but mostly I am content to watch. There is a game called 'Bobby is going home'. Bobby is jumping across puts and dodging viscious greek letters(!). The sky is purple, and the sun is flying around the sky in a figure 8 pattern. Bobby reaches the edge of the screen and moves to the next: the sun becomes a giant bird! I am now convinced that the atari 2600 was designed by and for acid users.\n\nI am walking to the kitchen to get a drink of water. The observing part of my brain realizes how absurd te entire situation is. It thinks of Peter Fonda: the perfect icon of the ridiculousness of LSD. For a brief moment I am standing behind myself watching: I AM Peter Fonda. I get my water, set it on a shelf, forget where it is, return, find it, drink it. We go to the bedroom to look at the ceiling, which is a sort of lumpy stucco. On the way, we notice a poster which depicts farm animals picketing. All of them are carrying signs except for the duck, who has a small red banner. We are sure that this is very important, but cannot decide why. I look at myself in the mirror and... there I am! And I can even move my mouth and eyes! I am happy to see this.\n\nWe have watched the ceiling for a while but we are both feeling restless. It has been quite a few hours now, and she is clearly overmost of it. I am still feeling strange, but I am definitely over the peak. We decide that, despite the cold and the icy streets, we are going to walk round outside a little bit.\n\nOut in the hallway. Bare white walls. No furniture except for a salvaged church pew with a life-sized cast of a tombstone sitting on it. We reach the front door and she tries to open it. Nothing. It is frozen. My mind races: the night before her boyfriend was late getting home from work and we had locked the keys in the apartment. We were stuck out in the rain for two hours. Now we want to get back out and we are locked IN! The perfect symmetry! I am overcome by the humor of the situation. am I laughing? I feel as though I am splitting apart from the waist up, becoming multiple images, like a photograph taken under strobe lights. But none of the motion is actually happening, is it? Is it?\n\nThe door finally opens - it was frozen shut - and we leave the house. I loo0k at the snow underneath the drainspout and admite the pefect fractal curve of crystals that are formed where water dripped onto it and froze. We walk down the street. The cold is severe, and I am starting to lose track of my body. Am I here? We walk down another street, but time is beginning to come apart. I am no longer experiencing my existance as a steady stream. It is a series of three basic images: looking forward, looking sideways, looking down at my feet. Each step I take the image changes in a cycle. This goes on forever, quite literally.\n\nWe are at a bus stop. A bus pulls up and the images speed up. I slide back into normal time and we decide not to get on the bus. I slide back to the ccling images, but there are more of them, closer together. We are in a richer neighborhood now. It is very dark, and all of the houses seem abandoned. We do not stay long. We are back on the main street, heading to the apartment. We pass a gas station. There is a large van filled with police. I feel unmoved: this is just the part where I act normal. We walk past and nobody pays the slightest bit of attention. I feel as if I am not actually connected to my body, but am in fact floating inside of it and trying to steer it around. She mentions something she read about that very sensation, though I had not mentioned it to her. 'I know exactly what you mean' I say loudly. The man walking his dog past us looks at me disapprovingly. 'But he doesn't,' I say, trying hard not to burst out laughing.\n\nWe are at an intersection. I cannot tell when and where the traffic is, but she is nearly back to normal and has no trouble negotiating the street crossing. As I step out into the road, however, I realize that I am no longer connected to my body at all: it is walking off across the road without me. Horror: what if I cannot catch up with it? The cars are coming! My body is almost across the street, but my consciousness is still standing right in the middle of it. I dash to the curb and, more or less, back into my body. I am not connected to it yet, but I have caught it and I fo not think it is going anywhere again. Sure enough, net time we cross a street, I only lag behind it slightly the first step or two. I am getting the hang of driving it around again.\n\nBack in the apartment. We are both getting tired, but there is no chance of sleeping yet. It is probably only 8 or 9 pm, anyway. We wander about, trying to decide what to do. It is cold. I am still shaken from beign outside. We want to watch a movie, but can't decide what. Finally we choose 'Heavenly Creatures', a personal favorite of each of us. Her copy is a pre-releasse bootleg in an unmarked tape. We heat up some vegan pizza-pocket type things (she is vegan; I hardly eat much meat, but thrive on cheese and find most vegan food of this kind a bit bland, so I am not overly aggressive about eating it) and start the tape. Soon we are both deeply absorbed in the movie. However, the way she relates to it is, naturally, quite different from the way I relate to it. Slowly but surely I begin to feel isolated. I begin to notice that whenever any of the characters on the screen are hostile, the picture becomes grainy and their faces begin to deform. Soon, not only are there distortions whenever characters are hostile or angry, but hissing sounds as well. And the angrier they get, the worse my food tastes. When they are happy, the food tastes better, the picture is clear, and there is no distortion or hissing. I begin to notice that the characters who are most grusomely deformed are men. And then it dawns on me: the distortions are not because of the LSD! No, what is really happening is that the tape was specially prepared in order to imprint me with some kind of anti-male, anti-heterosexual personality! That is why it the tape was not labeled. I begin to feel very uncomfortable. On the screen, people begin to grow horns and their faces twist into hideous grimaces. About halfway into the movie, there is a scene in which the main character loses her virginity to a particularly unpleasant, rattish man. As he is about to reach orgasm... the tape breaks! We stop the vcr and rewind it a bit to see if that will help, but there is no picture when we play. We rewind some more: still no picture. The tape is blank.\n\nWe have not gotten the tape to work, despite 15 minutes or so of sitting and looking at the VCR. I get up to go to the bathroom. Once in the bathroom, I look into the mirror. Throughout the trip, I have had menthol lip balm on, and it has made me unable to feel (and therefore, unable to remember the existance of ) the lower half of my face. Off an on, I have felt that my facial expressions are actually the facial expressions of people I am looking at, but happening on my face. This is an opportunity to test that. I look in the mirror. There I am, just like last time. I think to myself 'I am not sure exactly who I am, but I am sure that whoever I am I like it a lot.'\n\nA few hours have gone by. I am much closer to baseline now. Just tired, and my thought patterns are strange. Her boyfriend comes home and we sit and talk for a while. He reads our book. We keep him awake until about 2am, at which point we are all exhausted. They go to bed, and I turn off the lights and lie down on the couch. As I am about to close my eyes, I notice that the pattern on the couch is not just a pattern: it is a flaming, one eyed bird, and it is swooping down at me out of the cushion. I look at it for a moment, trying to decide whether or not we will be friends. I finally determine that we will get along, and close my eyes.\n\nMild closed-eye visuals as I fall asleep: moire patterns, kalidescope patterns, flying down chrome tunnels. At one point I am standing inside a strange house, looking out the window on the front door. Outside the window, there is a porch with a chair on it. On the chair sits a decaying corpse wearing a moth-eaten suit. I soon decide that I do not ilike this and go back to the tunnels and patterns.\n\nAbout an hour later, I wake up. There is a scratching sound: mice in the walls! And... my mostly uneaten vegan pizza is still sitting on a plate by the couch. If the mice decide the y want to eat it, they might crawl over me to get to it! I must move it away!\n\nEpilogue:\n\nThat is a basic account of what I can remember off the top of my head. It has been nearly three months, and I have been consistently much happier, much more able to focus, much more aware of the world around me, much more sure of who I am. I have always been pretty strong in all of these respects (though I am occasionally depressed for a week or two, as are most people I know), but since taking acid I feel as though they have all solidified. I know exactly who I am and where I am. While I might not be satisfied with everyhting in my life or th world, I am happy to be in it, as trite as that sounds. I waited until I was in an especially good state mentally before taking the acid, and I believe that it did a lot help imprint tthat state of mind into my personality much more deeply than it already was. For all the talk about LSD changing people's lives and personalities, I found that - much like hypnosis - it only created potential; the actual change was mad eby my own psyche. To draw upon the overused but very effective Huxley metaphor, LSD opens a door in your mind. But it does not make you walk through that door; that is up to you.\n\nWould I do LSD again? most definitely, if the opportunity to do it in a comfortable, safe manner presented itself. I would also be curious to try performing routine activities (shopping for food; visiting a busy mall; going to a movie) under low doses once or twice. At some point I am interested in trying DMT (which was the drug that I first began researching before deciding on LSD). Despite the fact that some of the later parts of that first trip were not what most people would consider pleasant, and were certainly not fun, I did not consider them 'negative' experiences at the time nor do I now. The only thing that I would really be unhappy about repeating would be crossing the street the first time.\n\nI would not outright recommend LSD to anyone. Moreso than most drugs, it is a very complex descision. I HAVE recommended that a couple of my friends who have not yet tried it but have some interest should spend some time reading about it and working at becoming comfortable with themselves before they even consider taking it. Sure, it is possible to just go out and do it without any trouble, but I cannot imagine that it would be nearly as satisfying, at east the first time. I think that it is incredibly important to have someone who you trust to guide you on your first trip. This has been said many times, but once more couldn't hurt.\n\nOne of the things that really helped me deal with some of the more uncomfortable moments was my firm belief that therre is no such thing as a 'bad' trip. A trip can be uncomfortable or downright frightening, but that is only 'bad' if the tripper interprets it that way. Some of the 'worst' experiences I've heard about from friends sound like some of the 'best' experiences I had (melting into the couch, for example - many other inexperienced people I have talked to were not at all comfortable when similar things happened to them). At least for me, remembering that 'good' and 'bad' are just human inventions that have no real bearing on the experience kept me from struggling against the uncomfortable moments, which is important.\n\nIf you go into it with the right mindset, I think acid can be one of the most positive and profound experiences a person can have, whether it is a 'good' trip or not. \n\n","Mary Wollstonecraft (27 April 1759 – 10 September 1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of women's rights. Until the late 20th century, Wollstonecraft's life, which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships, received more attention than her writing. Today, Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.\n\nDuring her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a travel narrative, a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children's book. Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason.\n\nAfter Wollstonecraft's death, her widower published a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century. However, with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important.\n\nAfter two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by whom she had a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. She died eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter, Mary Shelley, who would became an accomplished writer and author of Frankenstein.\n\n\n\nWollstonecraft was born on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was the second of the seven children of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth. The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.\n\nTwo friendships shaped Wollstonecraft's early life. The first was with Jane Arden in Beverley. The two frequently read books together and attended lectures presented by Arden's father, a self-styled philosopher and scientist. Wollstonecraft revelled in the intellectual atmosphere of the Arden household and valued her friendship with Arden greatly, sometimes to the point of being emotionally possessive. Wollstonecraft wrote to her: \"I have formed romantic notions of friendship ... I am a little singular in my thoughts of love and friendship; I must have the first place or none.\" In some of Wollstonecraft's letters to Arden, she reveals the volatile and depressive emotions that would haunt her throughout her life. The second and more important friendship was with Fanny (Frances) Blood, introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in Hoxton who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind.\n\nUnhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck out on her own in 1778 and accepted a job as a lady's companion to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in Bath. However, Wollstonecraft had trouble getting along with the irascible woman (an experience she drew on when describing the drawbacks of such a position in Thoughts on the Education of Daughters, 1787). In 1780 she returned home, called back to care for her dying mother. Rather than return to Dawson's employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to her and her family throughout her life (she frequently gave pecuniary assistance to Blood's brother, for example).\n\nWollstonecraft had envisioned living in a female utopia with Blood; they made plans to rent rooms together and support each other emotionally and financially, but this dream collapsed under economic realities. In order to make a living, Wollstonecraft, her sisters, and Blood set up a school together in Newington Green, a Dissenting community. Blood soon became engaged and after their marriage her husband, Hugh Skeys, took her to Lisbon, Portugal, to improve her health, which had always been precarious. Despite the change of surroundings Blood's health further deteriorated when she became pregnant, and in 1785 Wollstonecraft left the school and followed Blood to nurse her, but to no avail. Moreover, her abandonment of the school led to its failure. Blood's death devastated Wollstonecraft and was part of the inspiration for her first novel, Mary: A Fiction (1788).\n\n\n\nAfter Blood's death, Wollstonecraft's friends helped her obtain a position as governess to the daughters of the Anglo-Irish Kingsborough family in Ireland. Although she could not get along with Lady Kingsborough, the children found her an inspiring instructor; Margaret King would later say she 'had freed her mind from all superstitions'. Some of Wollstonecraft's experiences during this year would make their way into her only children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788).\n\nFrustrated by the limited career options open to respectable yet poor women—an impediment which Wollstonecraft eloquently describes in the chapter of Thoughts on the Education of Daughters entitled 'Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left Without a Fortune'—she decided, after only a year as a governess, to embark upon a career as an author. This was a radical choice, since, at the time, few women could support themselves by writing. As she wrote to her sister Everina in 1787, she was trying to become 'the first of a new genus'. She moved to London and, assisted by the liberal publisher Joseph Johnson, found a place to live and work to support herself. She learned French and German and translated texts, most notably Of the Importance of Religious Opinions by Jacques Necker and Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children by Christian Gotthilf Salzmann. She also wrote reviews, primarily of novels, for Johnson's periodical, the Analytical Review. Wollstonecraft's intellectual universe expanded during this time, not only from the reading that she did for her reviews but also from the company she kept: she attended Johnson's famous dinners and met such luminaries as the radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine and the philosopher William Godwin. The first time Godwin and Wollstonecraft met, they were disappointed in each other. Godwin had come to hear Paine, but Wollstonecraft assailed him all night long, disagreeing with him on nearly every subject. Johnson himself, however, became much more than a friend; she described him in her letters as a father and a brother.\n\nWhile in London, Wollstonecraft pursued a relationship with the artist Henry Fuseli, even though he was already married. She was, she wrote, enraptured by his genius, 'the grandeur of his soul, that quickness of comprehension, and lovely sympathy'. She proposed a platonic living arrangement with Fuseli and his wife, but Fuseli's wife was appalled, and he broke off the relationship with Wollstonecraft. After Fuseli's rejection, Wollstonecraft decided to travel to France to escape the humiliation of the incident, and to participate in the revolutionary events that she had just celebrated in her recent Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790). She had written the Rights of Men in response to the Whig MP Edmund Burke's conservative critique of the French Revolution in Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) and it made her famous overnight. Reflections on the Revolution in France was published on 1 November 1790, and so angered Wollstonecraft that she spent the rest of the month writing her rebuttal. A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke was published on 29 November 1790, initially anonymously; the second edition of A Vindication of the Rights of Men was published on 18 December, and this time the publisher revealed Wollstonecraft as the author.\n\nWollstonecraft called the French Revolution a 'glorious chance to obtain more virtue and happiness than hitherto blessed our globe'. Against Burke's dismissal of the Third Estate as men of no account, Wollstonecraft wrote, 'Time may show, that this obscure throng knew more of the human heart and of legislation than the profligates of rank, emasculated by hereditary effeminacy'. About the events of 5–6 October 1789, when the royal family was marched from Versailles to Paris by a group of angry housewives, Burke praised Queen Marie Antoinette as a symbol of the refined elegance of the ancien régime, who was surrounded by 'furies from hell, in the abused shape of the vilest of women'. Wollstonecraft by contrast wrote of the same event: 'Probably you [Burke] mean women who gained a livelihood by selling vegetables or fish, who never had any advantages of education'.\n\nWollstonecraft was compared with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist Joseph Priestley and Paine, whose Rights of Man (1791) would prove to be the most popular of the responses to Burke. She pursued the ideas she had outlined in Rights of Men in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), her most famous and influential work. Wollstonecraft's fame extended across the English channel, for when the French statesmen Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord visited London in 1792, he visited her, during which she asked that French girls be given the same right to an education that French boys were being offered by the new regime in France.\n\n\n\nWollstonecraft left for Paris in December 1792 and arrived about a month before Louis XVI was guillotined. Britain and France were on the brink of war when she left for Paris, and many advised her not to go. France was in turmoil. She sought out other British visitors such as Helen Maria Williams and joined the circle of expatriates then in the city. During her time in Paris, Wollstonecraft associated mostly with the moderate Girondins rather than the more radical Jacobins.\n\nOn 26 December 1792, Wollstonecraft saw the former king, Louis XVI, being taken to be tried before the National Assembly, and much to her own surprise, found 'the tears flow[ing] insensibly from my eyes, when I saw Louis sitting, with more dignity than I expected from his character, in a hackney coach going to meet death, where so many of his race have triumphed'.\n\nFrance declared war on Britain in February 1793. Wollstonecraft tried to leave France for Switzerland but was denied permission. In March, the Jacobin-dominated Committee of Public Safety came to power, instituting a totalitarian regime meant to mobilise France for the first 'total war'.\n\nLife became very difficult for foreigners in France. At first, they were put under police surveillance and, to get a residency permit, had to produce six written statements from Frenchmen testifying to their loyalty to the republic. Then, on 12 April 1793, all foreigners were forbidden to leave France. Despite her sympathy for the revolution, life for Wollstonecraft become very uncomfortable, all the more so as the Girondins had lost out to the Jacobins. Some of Wollstonecraft's French friends lost their heads to the guillotine as the Jacobins set out to annihilate their enemies.\n\nHaving just written the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft was determined to put her ideas to the test, and in the stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the French Revolution, she attempted her most experimental romantic attachment yet: she met and fell passionately in love with Gilbert Imlay, an American adventurer. Wollstonecraft put her own principles in practice by sleeping with Imlay even though they were not married, which was unacceptable behavior from a 'respectable' British woman. Whether or not she was interested in marriage, he was not, and she appears to have fallen in love with an idealisation of the man. Despite her rejection of the sexual component of relationships in the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft discovered that Imlay awakened her interest in sex.\n\nWollstonecraft was to a certain extent disillusioned by what she saw in France, writing that the people under the republic still behaved slavishly to those who held power while the government remained 'venal' and 'brutal'. Despite her disenchantment, Wollstonecraft wrote:\n\nI cannot yet give up the hope, that a fairer day is dawning on Europe, though I must hesitatingly observe, that little is to be expected from the narrow principle of commerce, which seems everywhere to be shoving aside the point of honour of the noblesse [nobility]. For the same pride of office, the same desire of power are still visible; with this aggravation, that, fearing to return to obscurity, after having but just acquired a relish for distinction, each hero, or philosopher, for all are dubbed with these new titles, endeavors to make hay while the sun shines.\n\nWollstonecraft was offended by the Jacobins' treatment of women. They refused to grant women equal rights, denounced 'Amazons', and made it clear that women were supposed to conform to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ideal of helpers to men. On 16 October 1793, Marie Antoinette was guillotined; among her charges and convictions, she was found guilty of committing incest with her son. Though Wollstonecraft disliked the former queen, she was troubled that the Jacobins would make Marie Antoinette's alleged perverse sexual acts one of the central reasons for the French people to hate her.\n\nAs the daily arrests and executions of the Reign of Terror began, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion. She was, after all, a British citizen known to be a friend of leading Girondins. On 31 October 1793, most of the Girondin leaders were guillotined; when Imlay broke the news to Wollstonecraft, she fainted. By this time, Imlay was taking advantage of the British blockade of France, which had caused shortages and worsened ever-growing inflation, by chartering ships to bring food and soap from America and dodge the British Royal Navy, goods that he could sell at a premium to Frenchmen who still had money. Imlay's blockade-running gained the respect and support of some Jacobins, ensuring, as he had hoped, his freedom during the Terror. To protect Wollstonecraft from arrest, Imlay made a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her an American citizen. Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined. Her sisters believed she had been imprisoned.\n\nWollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins 'nightmarish'. There were gigantic daytime parades requiring everyone to show themselves and lustily cheer lest they be suspected of inadequate commitment to the republic, as well as nighttime police raids to arrest 'enemies of the republic'. In a March 1794 letter to her sister Everina, Wollstonecraft wrote:\n\nIt is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind ... death and misery, in every shape of terrour, haunts this devoted country—I certainly am glad that I came to France, because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded.\n\nWollstonecraft soon became pregnant by Imlay, and on 14 May 1794 she gave birth to her first child, Fanny, naming her after perhaps her closest friend. Wollstonecraft was overjoyed; she wrote to a friend, 'My little Girl begins to suck so MANFULLY that her father reckons saucily on her writing the second part of the R[igh]ts of Woman' (emphasis hers). She continued to write avidly, despite not only her pregnancy and the burdens of being a new mother alone in a foreign country, but also the growing tumult of the French Revolution. While at Le Havre in northern France, she wrote a history of the early revolution, An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution, which was published in London in December 1794. Imlay, unhappy with the domestic-minded and maternal Wollstonecraft, eventually left her. He promised that he would return to her and Fanny at Le Havre, but his delays in writing to her and his long absences convinced Wollstonecraft that he had found another woman. Her letters to him are full of needy expostulations, which most critics explain as the expressions of a deeply depressed woman, while others say they resulted from her circumstances—a foreign woman alone with an infant in the middle of a revolution that had seen good friends imprisoned or executed.\n\nIn July 1794, Wollstonecraft welcomed the fall of the Jacobins, predicting it would be followed with a restoration of freedom of the press in France, which led her to return to Paris. In August 1794, Imlay departed for London and promised to return soon. In 1793, the British government had begun a crackdown on radicals, suspending civil liberties, imposing drastic censorship, and trying for treason anyone suspected of sympathy with the revolution, which led Wollstonecraft to fear she would be imprisoned if she returned.\n\nThe winter of 1794–95 was the coldest winter in Europe for over a century, which reduced Wollstonecraft and her daughter Fanny to desperate circumstances. The river Seine froze that winter, which made it impossible for ships to bring food and coal to Paris, leading to widespread starvation and deaths from the cold in the city. Wollstonecraft continued to write to Imlay, asking him to return to France at once, declaring she still had faith in the revolution and did not wish to return to Britain. After she left France on 7 April 1795, she continued to refer to herself as 'Mrs Imlay', even to her sisters, in order to bestow legitimacy upon her child.\n\nThe British historian Tom Furniss called An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution the most neglected of Wollstonecraft's books. It was first published in London in 1794, but a second edition did not appear until 1989. Later generations were more interested in her feminist writings rather than her account of the French Revolution, which Furniss has called her 'best work'. Wollstonecraft was not trained as a historian, but she used all sorts of journals, letters and documents recounting how ordinary people in France reacted to the revolution. She was trying to counteract what Furniss called the 'hysterical' anti-revolutionary mood in Britain, which depicted the revolution as due to the entire French nation's going mad. Wollstonecraft argued instead that the revolution arose from a set of social, economic and political conditions that left no other way out of the crisis that gripped France in 1789.\n\nAn Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution was a difficult balancing act for Wollstonecraft. She condemned the Jacobin regime and the Reign of Terror, but at same time she argued that the revolution was a great achievement, which led her to stop her history in late 1789 rather than write about the Terror of 1793–94. Edmund Burke had ended his Reflections on the Revolution in France with reference to the events of 5–6 October 1789, when a group of women from Paris forced the French royal family from the Palace of Versailles to Paris. Burke called the women 'furies from hell', while Wollstonecraft defended them as ordinary housewives angry about the lack of bread to feed their families. Against Burke's idealised portrait of Marie Antoinette as a noble victim of a mob, Wollstonecraft portrayed the queen as a femme fatale, a seductive, scheming and dangerous woman. Wollstonecraft argued that the values of the aristocracy corrupted women in a monarchy because women's main purpose in such a society was to bear sons to continue a dynasty, which essentially reduced a woman's value to her womb. Moreover, Wollstonecraft pointed out that unless a queen was a queen regnant, most queens were queen consorts, which meant a woman had to exercise influence via her husband or son, encouraging her to become more and more manipulative. Wollstonecraft argued that aristocratic values, by emphasising a woman's body and her ability to be charming over her mind and character, had encouraged women like Marie Antoinette to be manipulative and ruthless, making the queen into a corrupted and corrupting product of the ancien régime.\n\nSeeking Imlay, Wollstonecraft returned to London in April 1795, but he rejected her. In May 1795 she attempted to commit suicide, probably with laudanum, but Imlay saved her life (although it is unclear how). In a last attempt to win back Imlay, she embarked upon some business negotiations for him in Scandinavia, trying to recoup some of his losses. Wollstonecraft undertook this hazardous trip with only her young daughter and a maid. She recounted her travels and thoughts in letters to Imlay, many of which were eventually published as Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark in 1796. When she returned to England and came to the full realization that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide for the second time, leaving a note for Imlay:\n\n\"Let my wrongs sleep with me! Soon, very soon, shall I be at peace. When you receive this, my burning head will be cold ... I shall plunge into the Thames where there is the least chance of my being snatched from the death I seek. God bless you! May you never know by experience what you have made me endure. Should your sensibility ever awake, remorse will find its way to your heart; and, in the midst of business and sensual pleasure, I shall appear before you, the victim of your deviation from rectitude.\"\n\nShe then went out on a rainy night and \"to make her clothes heavy with water, she walked up and down about half an hour\" before jumping into the River Thames, but a stranger saw her jump and rescued her. Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, which was one of the calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured.\n\nGradually, Wollstonecraft returned to her literary life, becoming involved with Joseph Johnson's circle again, in particular with Mary Hays, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Sarah Siddons through William Godwin. Godwin and Wollstonecraft's unique courtship began slowly, but it eventually became a passionate love affair. Godwin had read her Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and later wrote that \"If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration.\" Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise Political Justice. After their marriage on 29 March 1797, Godwin and Wollstonecraft moved to 29 The Polygon, Somers Town. Godwin rented an apartment 20 doors away at 17 Evesham Buildings in Chalton Street as a study, so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by letter. By all accounts, theirs was a happy and stable, though brief, relationship.\n\n\n\nOn 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft gave birth to her second daughter, Mary. Although the delivery seemed to go well initially, the placenta broke apart during the birth and became infected; childbed fever was a common and often fatal occurrence in the eighteenth century. After several days of agony, Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia on 10 September. Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend Thomas Holcroft, \"I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again.\" She was buried at Old Saint Pancras Churchyard, where her tombstone reads, \"Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: Born 27 April 1759: Died 10 September 1797.\" (In 1851, her remains were moved by her grandson Percy Florence Shelley to his family tomb in St Peter's Church, Bournemouth.) Her monument in the churchyard lies to the north-east of the church just north of Sir John Soane's grave. Her husband was buried with her on his death in 1836, as was his second wife, Mary Jane Godwin (1766–1841).\n\nIn January 1798 Godwin published his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Although Godwin felt that he was portraying his wife with love, compassion, and sincerity, many readers were shocked that he would reveal Wollstonecraft's illegitimate children, love affairs, and suicide attempts. The Romantic poet Robert Southey accused him of \"the want of all feeling in stripping his dead wife naked\" and vicious satires such as The Unsex'd Females were published. Godwin's Memoirs portrays Wollstonecraft as a woman deeply invested in feeling who was balanced by his reason and as more of a religious sceptic than her own writings suggest. Godwin's views of Wollstonecraft were perpetuated throughout the nineteenth century and resulted in poems such as \"Wollstonecraft and Fuseli\" by British poet Robert Browning and that by William Roscoe which includes the lines:\n\n\n\nWollstonecraft has what scholar Cora Kaplan labelled in 2002 a \"curious\" legacy that has evolved over time: \"for an author-activist adept in many genres ... up until the last quarter-century Wollstonecraft's life has been read much more closely than her writing\". After the devastating effect of Godwin's Memoirs, Wollstonecraft's reputation lay in tatters for nearly a century; she was pilloried by such writers as Maria Edgeworth, who patterned the \"freakish\" Harriet Freke in Belinda (1801) after her. Other novelists such as Mary Hays, Charlotte Turner Smith, Fanny Burney, and Jane West created similar figures, all to teach a \"moral lesson\" to their readers. (Hays had been a close friend, and helped nurse her in her dying days.)\n\nIn contrast, there was one writer of the generation after Wollstonecraft who apparently did not share the judgmental views of her contemporaries. Jane Austen never mentioned the earlier woman by name, but several of her novels contain positive allusions to Wollstonecraft’s work. The American literary scholar Anne K. Mellor notes several examples. In Pride and Prejudice, Mr Wickham seems to be based upon the sort of man Wollstonecraft claimed that standing armies produce, while the sarcastic remarks of protagonist Elizabeth Bennet about \"female accomplishments\" closely echo Wollstonecraft's condemnation of these activities. The balance a woman must strike between feelings and reason in Sense and Sensibility follows what Wollstonecraft recommended in her novel Mary, while the moral equivalence Austen drew in Mansfield Park between slavery and the treatment of women in British society tracks one of Wollstonecraft's favorite arguments. In Persuasion, Austen's characterization of Anne Eliot (as well as her late mother before her) as better qualified than her father to manage the family estate also echoes a Wollstonecraft thesis.\n\nScholar Virginia Sapiro states that few read Wollstonecraft's works during the nineteenth century as \"her attackers implied or stated that no self-respecting woman would read her work\". (Still, as Craciun points out, new editions of Rights of Woman appeared in the UK in the 1840s and in the US in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s. ) If readers were few, then many were inspired; one such reader was Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who read Rights of Woman at age 12 and whose poem Aurora Leigh reflected Wollstonecraft's unwavering focus on education. Lucretia Mott, a Quaker minister, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Americans who met in 1840 at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, discovered they both had read Wollstonecraft, and they agreed upon the need for (what became) the Seneca Falls Convention, an influential women's rights meeting held in 1848. Another woman who read Wollstonecraft was George Eliot, a prolific writer of reviews, articles, novels, and translations. In 1855, she devoted an essay to the roles and rights of women, comparing Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller. Fuller was an American journalist, critic, and women's rights activist who, like Wollstonecraft, had travelled to the Continent and had been involved in the struggle for reform (in this case the Roman Republic)—and she had a child by a man without marrying him. Wollstonecraft's children's tales were adapted by Charlotte Mary Yonge in 1870.\n\nWollstonecraft's work was exhumed with the rise of the movement to give women a political voice. First was an attempt at rehabilitation in 1879 with the publication of Wollstonecraft's Letters to Imlay, with prefatory memoir by Charles Kegan Paul. Then followed the first full-length biography, which was by Elizabeth Robins Pennell; it appeared in 1884 as part of a series by the Roberts Brothers on famous women. Millicent Garrett Fawcett, a suffragist and later president of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, wrote the introduction to the centenary edition (i.e. 1892) of the Rights of Woman; it cleansed the memory of Wollstonecraft and claimed her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote. By 1898, Wollstonecraft was the subject of a first doctoral thesis and its resulting book.\n\nWith the advent of the modern feminist movement, women as politically dissimilar from each other as Virginia Woolf and Emma Goldman embraced Wollstonecraft's life story. By 1929 Woolf described Wollstonecraft—her writing, arguments, and \"experiments in living\"—as immortal: \"she is alive and active, she argues and experiments, we hear her voice and trace her influence even now among the living\". Others, however, continued to decry Wollstonecraft's lifestyle. A biography published in 1932 refers to recent reprints of her works, incorporating new research, and to a \"study\" in 1911, a play in 1922, and another biography in 1924. Interest in her never completely died, with full-length biographies in 1937 and 1951\n\nWith the emergence of feminist criticism in academia in the 1960s and 1970s, Wollstonecraft's works returned to prominence. Their fortunes reflected that of the second wave of the North American feminist movement itself; for example, in the early 1970s, six major biographies of Wollstonecraft were published that presented her \"passionate life in apposition to [her] radical and rationalist agenda\". The feminist artwork The Dinner Party, first exhibited in 1979, features a place setting for Wollstonecraft. In the 1980s and 1990s, yet another image of Wollstonecraft emerged, one which described her as much more a creature of her time; scholars such as Claudia Johnson, Gary Kelly, and Virginia Sapiro demonstrated the continuity between Wollstonecraft's thought and other important eighteenth-century ideas regarding topics such as sensibility, economics, and political theory.\n\nWollstonecraft's work has also had an effect on feminism outside the academy in recent years. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a political writer and former Muslim who is critical of Islam in general and its dictates regarding women in particular, cited the Rights of Woman in her autobiography Infidel and wrote that she was \"inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights\". British writer Caitlin Moran, author of the best-selling How to Be a Woman, described herself as \"half Wollstonecraft\" to the New Yorker. She has also inspired more widely. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, the Indian economist and philosopher who first identified the missing women of Asia, draws repeatedly on Wollstonecraft as a political philosopher in The Idea of Justice.\n\nSeveral plaques have been erected to honour Wollstonecraft.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of Wollstonecraft's early productions are about education; she assembled an anthology of literary extracts \"for the improvement of young women\" entitled The Female Reader and she translated two children's works, Maria Geertruida van de Werken de Cambon's Young Grandison and Christian Gotthilf Salzmann's Elements of Morality. Her own writings also addressed the topic. In both her conduct book Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787) and her children's book Original Stories from Real Life (1788), Wollstonecraft advocates educating children into the emerging middle-class ethos: self-discipline, honesty, frugality, and social contentment. Both books also emphasize the importance of teaching children to reason, revealing Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to the important seventeenth-century educational philosopher John Locke. However, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his and links it to the discourse of sensibility popular at the end of the eighteenth century. Both texts also advocate the education of women, a controversial topic at the time and one which she would return to throughout her career, most notably in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Wollstonecraft argues that well-educated women will be good wives and mothers and ultimately contribute positively to the nation.\n\n\n\nPublished in response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), which was a defence of constitutional monarchy, aristocracy, and the Church of England, and an attack on Wollstonecraft's friend, the Rev Richard Price at the Newington Green Unitarian Church, Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) attacks aristocracy and advocates republicanism. Hers was the first response in a pamphlet war that subsequently became known as the Revolution Controversy, in which Thomas Paine's Rights of Man (1792) became the rallying cry for reformers and radicals.\n\nWollstonecraft attacked not only monarchy and hereditary privilege but also the language that Burke used to defend and elevate it. In a famous passage in the Reflections, Burke had lamented: \"I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her Marie Antoinette  with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone.\" Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as theatrical pity for the French queen—a pity they felt was at the expense of the people. Wollstonecraft was unique in her attack on Burke's gendered language. By redefining the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]] (1756), she undermined his rhetoric as well as his argument. Burke had associated the beautiful with weakness and femininity and the sublime with strength and masculinity; Wollstonecraft turns these definitions against him, arguing that his theatrical tableaux turn Burke's readers—the citizens—into weak women who are swayed by show. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia L. Johnson argues remains unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's defence of an unequal society founded on the passivity of women.\n\nIn her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system would lead to the continuation of slavery, simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling.\n\nThe Rights of Men was Wollstonecraft's first overtly political work, as well as her first feminist work; as Johnson contends, \"it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of Rights of Men she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career.\" It was this text that made her a well-known writer.\n\nA Vindication of the Rights of Woman is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society and then proceeds to redefine that position, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be \"companions\" to their husbands rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men. Large sections of the Rights of Woman respond vitriolically to conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and educational philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who wanted to deny women an education. (Rousseau famously argues in Émile (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men.) Wollstonecraft states that currently many women are silly and superficial (she refers to them, for example, as \"spaniels\" and \"toys\" ), but argues that this is not because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather because men have denied them access to education. Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that women's deficient educations have placed on them; she writes: \"Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison.\" She implies that, without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, women could achieve much more.\n\nWhile Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: \"Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.\" Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word did not come into existence until the 1890s.\n\nOne of Wollstonecraft's most scathing critiques in the Rights of Woman is of false and excessive sensibility, particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are \"blown about by every momentary gust of feeling\" and because they are \"the prey of their senses\" they cannot think rationally. In fact, she claims, they do harm not only to themselves but to the entire civilization: these are not women who can help refine a civilization—a popular eighteenth-century idea—but women who will destroy it. Wollstonecraft does not argue that reason and feeling should act independently of each other; rather, she believes that they should inform each other.\n\nIn addition to her larger philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft also lays out a specific educational plan. In the twelfth chapter of the Rights of Woman, \"On National Education\", she argues that all children should be sent to a \"country day school\" as well as given some education at home \"to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures.\" She also maintains that schooling should be co-educational, arguing that men and women, whose marriages are \"the cement of society\", should be \"educated after the same model.\"\n\nWollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle-class, which she describes as the \"most natural state\", and in many ways the Rights of Woman is inflected by a bourgeois view of the world. It encourages modesty and industry in its readers and attacks the uselessness of the aristocracy. But Wollstonecraft is not necessarily a friend to the poor; for example, in her national plan for education, she suggests that, after the age of nine, the poor, except for those who are brilliant, should be separated from the rich and taught in another school.\n\n\n\nBoth of Wollstonecraft's novels criticize what she viewed as the patriarchal institution of marriage and its deleterious effects on women. In her first novel, Mary: A Fiction (1788), the eponymous heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons; she fulfils her desire for love and affection outside of marriage with two passionate romantic friendships, one with a woman and one with a man. Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman (1798), an unfinished novel published posthumously and often considered Wollstonecraft's most radical feminist work, revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband; like Mary, Maria also finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate and a friendship with one of her keepers. Neither of Wollstonecraft's novels depict successful marriages, although she posits such relationships in the Rights of Woman. At the end of Mary, the heroine believes she is going \"to that world where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage\", presumably a positive state of affairs.\n\nBoth of Wollstonecraft's novels also critique the discourse of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular at the end of the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.\n\nFemale friendships are central to both of Wollstonecraft's novels, but it is the friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant. This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman is one of the first moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women.\n\nWollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is a deeply personal travel narrative. The twenty-five letters cover a wide range of topics, from sociological reflections on Scandinavia and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity to musings on her relationship with Imlay (although he is not referred to by name in the text). Using the rhetoric of the sublime, Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between the self and society. Reflecting the strong influence of Rousseau, Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark shares the themes of the French philosopher's Reveries of a Solitary Walker (1782): \"the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding\". While Rousseau ultimately rejects society, however, Wollstonecraft celebrates domestic scenes and industrial progress in her text.\n\nWollstonecraft promotes subjective experience, particularly in relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and sensibility. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works. As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women. In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to the world with a commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay.\n\nLetters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark was Wollstonecraft's most popular book in the 1790s. It sold well and was reviewed positively by most critics. Godwin wrote \"if ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book.\" It influenced Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who drew on its themes and its aesthetic.\n\n","\nDURING the dread reign of the Cholera in New York, I had accepted the\ninvitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement\nof his _cottage ornee_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around\nus all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling\nin the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books,\nwe should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful\nintelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city.\nNot a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some\nacquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily\nthe loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every\nmessenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.\nThat palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I\ncould neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was\nof a less excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in\nspirits, exerted himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical\nintellect was not at any time affected by unrealities. To the substances\nof terror he was sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no\napprehension.\n\nHis endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into\nwhich I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain\nvolumes which I had found in his library. These were of a character to\nforce into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition\nlay latent in my bosom. I had been reading these books without his\nknowledge, and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible\nimpressions which had been made upon my fancy.\n\nA favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens--a belief\nwhich, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed\nto defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions--he\nmaintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,--I\ncontending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity-\nthat is to say, without apparent traces of suggestion--had in itself the\nunmistakable elements of truth, and was entitled to as much respect\nas that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of\ngenius.\n\nThe fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had\noccurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had\nin it so much of the portentous character, that I might well have been\nexcused for regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time\nso confounded and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could\nmake up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend.\n\nNear the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at\nan open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a\nview of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been\ndenuded by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its\ntrees. My thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to\nthe gloom and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes\nfrom the page, they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an\nobject--upon some living monster of hideous conformation, which very\nrapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally\nin the dense forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I\ndoubted my own sanity--or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and\nmany minutes passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was\nneither mad nor in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which\nI distinctly saw, and calmly surveyed through the whole period of\nits progress), my readers, I fear, will feel more difficulty in being\nconvinced of these points than even I did myself.\n\nEstimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of\nthe large trees near which it passed--the few giants of the forest which\nhad escaped the fury of the land-slide--I concluded it to be far larger\nthan any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line, because\nthe shape of the monster suggested the idea--the hull of one of our\nseventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general\noutline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a\nproboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as\nthe body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was\nan immense quantity of black shaggy hair--more than could have been\nsupplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this\nhair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike\nthose of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending\nforward, parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a\ngigantic staff, thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure\ncrystal and in shape a perfect prism,--it reflected in the most gorgeous\nmanner the rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a\nwedge with the apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs\nof wings--each wing nearly one hundred yards in length--one pair being\nplaced above the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each\nscale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that\nthe upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But\nthe chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a\nDeath’s Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and\nwhich was as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of\nthe body, as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While\nI regarded the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance\non its breast, with a feeling or horror and awe--with a sentiment of\nforthcoming evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of\nthe reason, I perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis\nsuddenly expand themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so\nloud and so expressive of wo, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell\nand as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once,\nfainting, to the floor.\n\nUpon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend\nof what I had seen and heard--and I can scarcely explain what feeling of\nrepugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.\n\nAt length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we\nwere sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition--I\noccupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa\nnear at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to\ngive him an account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end--at first\nlaughed heartily--and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as\nif my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again\nhad a distinct view of the monster--to which, with a shout of absolute\nterror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly--but maintained\nthat he saw nothing--although I designated minutely the course of the\ncreature, as it made its way down the naked face of the hill.\n\nI was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an\nomen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I\nthrew myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried\nmy face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no\nlonger apparent.\n\nMy host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his\ndemeanor, and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the\nconformation of the visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied\nhim on this head, he sighed deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable\nburden, and went on to talk, with what I thought a cruel calmness, of\nvarious points of speculative philosophy, which had heretofore formed\nsubject of discussion between us. I remember his insisting very\nespecially (among other things) upon the idea that the principle\nsource of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of\nthe understanding to under-rate or to over-value the importance of an\nobject, through mere mis-admeasurement of its propinquity. “To estimate\nproperly, for example,” he said, “the influence to be exercised on\nmankind at large by the thorough diffusion of Democracy, the distance\nof the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should\nnot fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can you tell me one writer\non the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch\nof the subject worthy of discussion at all?”\n\nHe here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth\none of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to\nexchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine\nprint of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the\nbook, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.\n\n“But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the\nmonster, I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you\nwhat it was. In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy\naccount of the genus Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order\nLepidoptera, of the class of Insecta--or insects. The account runs thus:\n\n“‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic\nappearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation\nof the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of\nmandibles and downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior\nby a stiff hair; antennae in the form of an elongated club, prismatic;\nabdomen pointed, The Death’s--headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror\namong the vulgar, at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it\nutters, and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”\n\nHe here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing\nhimself accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of\nbeholding “the monster.”\n\n“Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed--“it is reascending the face\nof the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.\nStill, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,--for\nthe fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some\nspider has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the\nsixteenth of an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth\nof an inch distant from the pupil of my eye.”\n\n","I've got a Dungeon Master's Guide, I've got a 12-sided die.\nI've got Kitty Pryde, and Nightcrawler too, waiting there for me.\nYes I do, I do.\n\nI've got posters on the wall, my favorite rock group KISS.\nI've got Ace Frehley, and I've got Peter Criss waiting there for me.\nYes I do, I do\n\nI've got an electric guitar.\nI play my stupid songs.\nI write these stupid words, and I love every one waiting there for me.\nYes I do, I do\n\nIn the garage, I feel safe.\nNo one cares about my ways.\nIn the garage where I belong, no one hears me sing this song.\nIn the garage.\n\n","Ooh!

Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?\nDoesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.\nShe is a kook.\n","'It all arose, you must know, from Andrey being fond of a drop of drink\nat that time--though he's a sober enough man now by all account, so much\nthe better for him.  Jane, his bride, you see, was somewhat older than\nAndrey; how much older I don't pretend to say; she was not one of our\nparish, and the register alone may be able to tell that.  But, at any\nrate, her being a little ahead of her young man in mortal years, coupled\nwith other bodily circumstances--'\n\n('Ah, poor thing!' sighed the women.)\n\n'--made her very anxious to get the thing done before he changed his\nmind; and 'twas with a joyful countenance (they say) that she, with\nAndrey and his brother and sister-in-law, marched off to church one\nNovember morning as soon as 'twas day a'most, to be made one with Andrey\nfor the rest of her life.  He had left our place long before it was\nlight, and the folks that were up all waved their lanterns at him, and\nflung up their hats as he went.\n\n'The church of her parish was a mile and more from the houses, and, as it\nwas a wonderful fine day for the time of year, the plan was that as soon\nas they were married they would make out a holiday by driving straight\noff to Port Bredy, to see the ships and the sea and the sojers, instead\nof coming back to a meal at the house of the distant relation she lived\nwi', and moping about there all the afternoon.\n\n'Well, some folks noticed that Andrey walked with rather wambling steps\nto church that morning; the truth o't was that his nearest neighbour's\nchild had been christened the day before, and Andrey, having stood\ngodfather, had stayed all night keeping up the christening, for he had\nsaid to himself, \"Not if I live to be thousand shall I again be made a\ngodfather one day, and a husband the next, and perhaps a father the next,\nand therefore I'll make the most of the blessing.\"  So that when he\nstarted from home in the morning he had not been in bed at all.  The\nresult was, as I say, that when he and his bride-to-he walked up the\nchurch to get married, the pa'son (who was a very strict man inside the\nchurch, whatever he was outside) looked hard at Andrey, and said, very\nsharp:\n\n'\"How's this, my man?  You are in liquor.  And so early, too.  I'm\nashamed of you!\"\n\n'\"Well, that's true, sir,\" says Andrey.  \"But I can walk straight enough\nfor practical purposes.  I can walk a chalk line,\" he says (meaning no\noffence), \"as well as some other folk: and--\" (getting hotter)--\"I reckon\nthat if you, Pa'son Billy Toogood, had kept up a christening all night so\nthoroughly as I have done, you wouldn't be able to stand at all; d--- me\nif you would!\"\n\n'This answer made Pa'son Billy--as they used to call him--rather spitish,\nnot to say hot, for he was a warm-tempered man if provoked, and he said,\nvery decidedly: \"Well, I cannot marry you in this state; and I will not!\nGo home and get sober!\"  And he slapped the book together like a\nrat-trap.\n\n'Then the bride burst out crying as if her heart would break, for very\nfear that she would lose Andrey after all her hard work to get him, and\nbegged and implored the pa'son to go on with the ceremony.  But no.\n\n'\"I won't be a party to your solemnizing matrimony with a tipsy man,\"\nsays Mr. Toogood.  \"It is not right and decent.  I am sorry for you, my\nyoung woman, but you'd better go home again.  I wonder how you could\nthink of bringing him here drunk like this!\"\n\n'\"But if--if he don't come drunk he won't come at all, sir!\" she says,\nthrough her sobs.\n\n'\"I can't help that,\" says the pa'son; and plead as she might, it did not\nmove him.  Then she tried him another way.\n\n'\"Well, then, if you'll go home, sir, and leave us here, and come back to\nthe church in an hour or two, I'll undertake to say that he shall be as\nsober as a judge,\" she cries.  \"We'll bide here, with your permission;\nfor if he once goes out of this here church unmarried, all Van Amburgh's\nhorses won't drag him back again!\"\n\n'\"Very well,\" says the parson.  \"I'll give you two hours, and then I'll\nreturn.\"\n\n'\"And please, sir, lock the door, so that we can't escape!\" says she.\n\n'\"Yes,\" says the parson.\n\n'\"And let nobody know that we are here.\"\n\n'The pa'son then took off his clane white surplice, and went away; and\nthe others consulted upon the best means for keeping the matter a secret,\nwhich it was not a very hard thing to do, the place being so lonely, and\nthe hour so early.  The witnesses, Andrey's brother and brother's wife,\nneither one o' which cared about Andrey's marrying Jane, and had come\nrather against their will, said they couldn't wait two hours in that hole\nof a place, wishing to get home to Longpuddle before dinner-time.  They\nwere altogether so crusty that the clerk said there was no difficulty in\ntheir doing as they wished.  They could go home as if their brother's\nwedding had actually taken place and the married couple had gone onward\nfor their day's pleasure jaunt to Port Bredy as intended, he, the clerk,\nand any casual passer-by would act as witnesses when the pa'son came\nback.\n\n'This was agreed to, and away Andrey's relations went, nothing loath, and\nthe clerk shut the church door and prepared to lock in the couple.  The\nbride went up and whispered to him, with her eyes a-streaming still.\n\n'\"My dear good clerk,\" she says, \"if we bide here in the church, folk may\nsee us through the winders, and find out what has happened; and 'twould\ncause such a talk and scandal that I never should get over it: and\nperhaps, too, dear Andrey might try to get out and leave me!  Will ye\nlock us up in the tower, my dear good clerk?\" she says.  \"I'll tole him\nin there if you will.\"\n\n'The clerk had no objection to do this to oblige the poor young woman,\nand they toled Andrey into the tower, and the clerk locked 'em both up\nstraightway, and then went home, to return at the end of the two hours.\n\n'Pa'son Toogood had not been long in his house after leaving the church\nwhen he saw a gentleman in pink and top-boots ride past his windows, and\nwith a sudden flash of heat he called to mind that the hounds met that\nday just on the edge of his parish.  The pa'son was one who dearly loved\nsport, and much he longed to be there.\n\n'In short, except o' Sundays and at tide-times in the week, Pa'son Billy\nwas the life o' the Hunt.  'Tis true that he was poor, and that he rode\nall of a heap, and that his black mare was rat-tailed and old, and his\ntops older, and all over of one colour, whitey-brown, and full o' cracks.\nBut he'd been in at the death of three thousand foxes.  And--being a\nbachelor man--every time he went to bed in summer he used to open the bed\nat bottom and crawl up head foremost, to mind 'em of the coming winter and\nthe good sport he'd have, and the foxes going to earth.  And whenever\nthere was a christening at the Squire's, and he had dinner there\nafterwards, as he always did, he never failed to christen the chiel over\nagain in a bottle of port wine.\n\n'Now the clerk was the parson's groom and gardener and jineral manager,\nand had just got back to his work in the garden when he, too, saw the\nhunting man pass, and presently saw lots more of 'em, noblemen and\ngentry, and then he saw the hounds, the huntsman, Jim Treadhedge, the\nwhipper-in, and I don't know who besides.  The clerk loved going to cover\nas frantical as the pa'son, so much so that whenever he saw or heard the\npack he could no more rule his feelings than if they were the winds of\nheaven.  He might be bedding, or he might be sowing--all was forgot.  So\nhe throws down his spade and rushes in to the pa'son, who was by this\ntime as frantical to go as he.\n\n'\"That there mare of yours, sir, do want exercise bad, very bad, this\nmorning!\" the clerk says, all of a tremble.  \"Don't ye think I'd better\ntrot her round the downs for an hour, sir?\"\n\n'\"To be sure, she does want exercise badly.  I'll trot her round myself,\"\nsays the parson.\n\n'\"Oh--you'll trot her yerself?  Well, there's the cob, sir.  Really that\ncob is getting oncontrollable through biding in a stable so long!  If you\nwouldn't mind my putting on the saddle--\"\n\n'\"Very well.  Take him out, certainly,\" says the pa'son, never caring\nwhat the clerk did so long as he himself could get off immediately.  So,\nscrambling into his riding-boots and breeches as quick as he could, he\nrode off towards the meet, intending to be back in an hour.  No sooner\nwas he gone than the clerk mounted the cob, and was off after him.  When\nthe pa'son got to the meet, he found a lot of friends, and was as jolly\nas he could be: the hounds found a'most as soon as they threw off, and\nthere was great excitement.  So, forgetting that he had meant to go back\nat once, away rides the pa'son with the rest o' the hunt, all across the\nfallow ground that lies between Lippet Wood and Green's Copse; and as he\ngalloped he looked behind for a moment, and there was the clerk close to\nhis heels.\n\n'\"Ha, ha, clerk--you here?\" he says.\n\n'\"Yes, sir, here be I,\" says t'other.\n\n'\"Fine exercise for the horses!\"\n\n'\"Ay, sir--hee, hee!\" says the clerk.\n\n'So they went on and on, into Green's Copse, then across to Higher\nJirton; then on across this very turnpike-road to Climmerston Ridge, then\naway towards Yalbury Wood: up hill and down dale, like the very wind, the\nclerk close to the pa'son, and the pa'son not far from the hounds.  Never\nwas there a finer run knowed with that pack than they had that day; and\nneither pa'son nor clerk thought one word about the unmarried couple\nlocked up in the church tower waiting to get j'ined.\n\n'\"These hosses of yours, sir, will be much improved by this!\" says the\nclerk as he rode along, just a neck behind the pa'son.  \"'Twas a happy\nthought of your reverent mind to bring 'em out to-day.  Why, it may be\nfrosty in a day or two, and then the poor things mid not be able to leave\nthe stable for weeks.\"\n\n'\"They may not, they may not, it is true.  A merciful man is merciful to\nhis beast,\" says the pa'son.\n\n'\"Hee, hee!\" says the clerk, glancing sly into the pa'son's eye.\n\n'\"Ha, ha!\" says the pa'son, a-glancing back into the clerk's.  \"Halloo!\"\nhe shouts, as he sees the fox break cover at that moment.\n\n'\"Halloo!\" cries the clerk.  \"There he goes!  Why, dammy, there's two\nfoxes--\"\n\n'\"Hush, clerk, hush!  Don't let me hear that word again!  Remember our\ncalling.\"\n\n'\"True, sir, true.  But really, good sport do carry away a man so, that\nhe's apt to forget his high persuasion!\"  And the next minute the corner\nof the clerk's eye shot again into the corner of the pa'son's, and the\npa'son's back again to the clerk's.  \"Hee, hee!\" said the clerk.\n\n'\"Ha, ha!\" said Pa'son Toogood.\n\n'\"Ah, sir,\" says the clerk again, \"this is better than crying Amen to\nyour Ever-and-ever on a winter's morning!\"\n\n'\"Yes, indeed, clerk!  To everything there's a season,\" says Pa'son\nToogood, quite pat, for he was a learned Christian man when he liked, and\nhad chapter and ve'se at his tongue's end, as a pa'son should.\n\n'At last, late in the day, the hunting came to an end by the fox running\ninto a' old woman's cottage, under her table, and up the clock-case.  The\npa'son and clerk were among the first in at the death, their faces\na-staring in at the old woman's winder, and the clock striking as he'd\nnever been heard to strik' before.  Then came the question of finding\ntheir way home.\n\n'Neither the pa'son nor the clerk knowed how they were going to do this,\nfor their beasts were wellnigh tired down to the ground.  But they\nstarted back-along as well as they could, though they were so done up\nthat they could only drag along at a' amble, and not much of that at a\ntime.\n\n'\"We shall never, never get there!\" groaned Mr. Toogood, quite bowed\ndown.\n\n'\"Never!\" groans the clerk.  \"'Tis a judgment upon us for our\niniquities!\"\n\n'\"I fear it is,\" murmurs the pa'son.\n\n'Well, 'twas quite dark afore they entered the pa'sonage gate, having\ncrept into the parish as quiet as if they'd stole a hammer, little\nwishing their congregation to know what they'd been up to all day long.\nAnd as they were so dog-tired, and so anxious about the horses, never\nonce did they think of the unmarried couple.  As soon as ever the horses\nhad been stabled and fed, and the pa'son and clerk had had a bit and a\nsup theirselves, they went to bed.\n\n'Next morning when Pa'son Toogood was at breakfast, thinking of the\nglorious sport he'd had the day before, the clerk came in a hurry to the\ndoor and asked to see him.\n\n'\"It has just come into my mind, sir, that we've forgot all about the\ncouple that we was to have married yesterday!\"\n\n'The half-chawed victuals dropped from the pa'son's mouth as if he'd been\nshot.  \"Bless my soul,\" says he, \"so we have!  How very awkward!\"\n\n'\"It is, sir; very.  Perhaps we've ruined the 'ooman!\"\n\n'\"Ah--to be sure--I remember!  She ought to have been married before.\"\n\n'\"If anything has happened to her up in that there tower, and no doctor\nor nuss--\"\n\n('Ah--poor thing!' sighed the women.)\n\n'\"--'twill be a quarter-sessions matter for us, not to speak of the\ndisgrace to the Church!\"\n\n'\"Good God, clerk, don't drive me wild!\" says the pa'son.  \"Why the hell\ndidn't I marry 'em, drunk or sober!\"  (Pa'sons used to cuss in them days\nlike plain honest men.)  \"Have you been to the church to see what\nhappened to them, or inquired in the village?\"\n\n'\"Not I, sir!  It only came into my head a moment ago, and I always like\nto be second to you in church matters.  You could have knocked me down\nwith a sparrer's feather when I thought o't, sir; I assure 'ee you\ncould!\"\n\n'Well, the parson jumped up from his breakfast, and together they went\noff to the church.\n\n'\"It is not at all likely that they are there now,\" says Mr. Toogood, as\nthey went; \"and indeed I hope they are not.  They be pretty sure to have\n'scaped and gone home.\"\n\n'However, they opened the church-hatch, entered the churchyard, and\nlooking up at the tower, there they seed a little small white face at the\nbelfry-winder, and a little small hand waving.  'Twas the bride.\n\n'\"God my life, clerk,\" says Mr. Toogood, \"I don't know how to face 'em!\"\nAnd he sank down upon a tombstone.  \"How I wish I hadn't been so cussed\nparticular!\"\n\n'\"Yes--'twas a pity we didn't finish it when we'd begun,\" the clerk said.\n\"Still, since the feelings of your holy priestcraft wouldn't let ye, the\ncouple must put up with it.\"\n\n'\"True, clerk, true!  Does she look as if anything premature had took\nplace?\"\n\n'\"I can't see her no lower down than her arm-pits, sir.\"\n\n'\"Well--how do her face look?\"\n\n'\"It do look mighty white!\"\n\n'\"Well, we must know the worst!  Dear me, how the small of my back do\nache from that ride yesterday! . . . But to more godly business!\"\n\n'They went on into the church, and unlocked the tower stairs, and\nimmediately poor Jane and Andrey busted out like starved mice from a\ncupboard, Andrey limp and sober enough now, and his bride pale and cold,\nbut otherwise as usual.\n\n'\"What,\" says the pa'son, with a great breath of relief, \"you haven't\nbeen here ever since?\"\n\n'\"Yes, we have, sir!\" says the bride, sinking down upon a seat in her\nweakness.  \"Not a morsel, wet or dry, have we had since!  It was\nimpossible to get out without help, and here we've stayed!\"\n\n'\"But why didn't you shout, good souls?\" said the pa'son.\n\n'\"She wouldn't let me,\" says Andrey.\n\n'\"Because we were so ashamed at what had led to it,\" sobs Jane.  \"We felt\nthat if it were noised abroad it would cling to us all our lives!  Once\nor twice Andrey had a good mind to toll the bell, but then he said: \"No;\nI'll starve first.  I won't bring disgrace on my name and yours, my\ndear.\"  And so we waited and waited, and walked round and round; but\nnever did you come till now!\"\n\n'\"To my regret!\" says the parson.  \"Now, then, we will soon get it over.\"\n\n'\"I--I should like some victuals,\" said Andrey, \"'twould gie me courage\nif it is only a crust o' bread and a' onion; for I am that leery that I\ncan feel my stomach rubbing against my backbone.\"\n\n'\"I think we had better get it done,\" said the bride, a bit anxious in\nmanner; \"since we are all here convenient, too!\"\n\n'Andrey gave way about the victuals, and the clerk called in a second\nwitness who wouldn't be likely to gossip about it, and soon the knot was\ntied, and the bride looked smiling and calm forthwith, and Andrey limper\nthan ever.\n\n'\"Now,\" said Pa'son Toogood, \"you two must come to my house, and have a\ngood lining put to your insides before you go a step further.\"\n\n'They were very glad of the offer, and went out of the churchyard by one\npath while the pa'son and clerk went out by the other, and so did not\nattract notice, it being still early.  They entered the rectory as if\nthey'd just come back from their trip to Port Bredy; and then they\nknocked in the victuals and drink till they could hold no more.\n\n'It was a long while before the story of what they had gone through was\nknown, but it was talked of in time, and they themselves laugh over it\nnow; though what Jane got for her pains was no great bargain after all.\n'Tis true she saved her name.'\n\n* * * * *\n\n'Was that the same Andrey who went to the squire's house as one of the\nChristmas fiddlers?' asked the seedsman.\n\n'No, no,' replied Mr. Profitt, the schoolmaster.  'It was his father did\nthat.  Ay, it was all owing to his being such a man for eating and\ndrinking.'  Finding that he had the ear of the audience, the schoolmaster\ncontinued without delay:--\n\n\n\nOLD ANDREY'S EXPERIENCE AS A MUSICIAN\n\n\n'I was one of the choir-boys at that time, and we and the players were to\nappear at the manor-house as usual that Christmas week, to play and sing\nin the hall to the squire's people and visitors (among 'em being the\narchdeacon, Lord and Lady Baxby, and I don't know who); afterwards going,\nas we always did, to have a good supper in the servants' hall.  Andrew\nknew this was the custom, and meeting us when we were starting to go, he\nsaid to us: \"Lord, how I should like to join in that meal of beef, and\nturkey, and plum-pudding, and ale, that you happy ones be going to just\nnow!  One more or less will make no difference to the squire.  I am too\nold to pass as a singing boy, and too bearded to pass as a singing girl;\ncan ye lend me a fiddle, neighbours, that I may come with ye as a\nbandsman?\"\n\n'Well, we didn't like to be hard upon him, and lent him an old one,\nthough Andrew knew no more of music than the Cerne Giant; and armed with\nthe instrument he walked up to the squire's house with the others of us\nat the time appointed, and went in boldly, his fiddle under his arm.  He\nmade himself as natural as he could in opening the music-books and moving\nthe candles to the best points for throwing light upon the notes; and all\nwent well till we had played and sung \"While shepherds watch,\" and \"Star,\narise,\" and \"Hark the glad sound.\"  Then the squire's mother, a tall\ngruff old lady, who was much interested in church-music, said quite\nunexpectedly to Andrew: \"My man, I see you don't play your instrument\nwith the rest.  How is that?\"\n\n'Every one of the choir was ready to sink into the earth with concern at\nthe fix Andrew was in.  We could see that he had fallen into a cold\nsweat, and how he would get out of it we did not know.\n\n'\"I've had a misfortune, mem,\" he says, bowing as meek as a child.\n\"Coming along the road I fell down and broke my bow.\"\n\n'\"Oh, I am sorry to hear that,\" says she.  \"Can't it be mended?\"\n\n'\"Oh no, mem,\" says Andrew.  \"'Twas broke all to splinters.\"\n\n'\"I'll see what I can do for you,\" says she.\n\n'And then it seemed all over, and we played \"Rejoice, ye drowsy mortals\nall,\" in D and two sharps.  But no sooner had we got through it than she\nsays to Andrew,\n\n'\"I've sent up into the attic, where we have some old musical\ninstruments, and found a bow for you.\"  And she hands the bow to poor\nwretched Andrew, who didn't even know which end to take hold of.  \"Now we\nshall have the full accompaniment,\" says she.\n\n'Andrew's face looked as if it were made of rotten apple as he stood in\nthe circle of players in front of his book; for if there was one person\nin the parish that everybody was afraid of, 'twas this hook-nosed old\nlady.  However, by keeping a little behind the next man he managed to\nmake pretence of beginning, sawing away with his bow without letting it\ntouch the strings, so that it looked as if he were driving into the tune\nwith heart and soul.  'Tis a question if he wouldn't have got through all\nright if one of the squire's visitors (no other than the archdeacon)\nhadn't noticed that he held the fiddle upside down, the nut under his\nchin, and the tail-piece in his hand; and they began to crowd round him,\nthinking 'twas some new way of performing.\n\n'This revealed everything; the squire's mother had Andrew turned out of\nthe house as a vile impostor, and there was great interruption to the\nharmony of the proceedings, the squire declaring he should have notice to\nleave his cottage that day fortnight.  However, when we got to the\nservants' hall there sat Andrew, who had been let in at the back door by\nthe orders of the squire's wife, after being turned out at the front by\nthe orders of the squire, and nothing more was heard about his leaving\nhis cottage.  But Andrew never performed in public as a musician after\nthat night; and now he's dead and gone, poor man, as we all shall be!'\n\n* * * * *\n\n'I had quite forgotten the old choir, with their fiddles and bass-viols,'\nsaid the home-comer, musingly.

A young teetotaler plays\nthe organ in church now, and plays it very well; though 'tis not quite\nsuch good music as in old times, because the organ is one of them that go\nwith a winch, and the young teetotaler says he can't always throw the\nproper feeling into the tune without wellnigh working his arms off.'\n\n'Why did they make the change, then?'\n\n'Well, partly because of fashion, partly because the old musicians got\ninto a sort of scrape.  A terrible scrape 'twas too--wasn't it, John?  I\nshall never forget it--never!  They lost their character as officers of\nthe church as complete as if they'd never had any character at all.'\n\n'That was very bad for them.'\n\n'Yes.'  The master-thatcher attentively regarded past times as if they\nlay about a mile off, and went on:--\n\n","Heee. GD GD. I so wan to give u a big bao bao. Sayang u la!","Article 901: Scope and Coverage\n1. This Chapter applies to standards-related measures of a Party, other than those covered by Section B of Chapter Seven (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade in goods or services between the Parties, and to measures of the Parties relating to such measures.\n2. Technical specifications prepared by governmental bodies for production or consumption requirements of such bodies shall be governed exclusively by Chapter Ten (Government Procurement).\nArticle 902: Extent of Obligations\n1. Article 105 (Extent of Obligations) does not apply to this Chapter.\n2. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure observance of Articles 904 through 908 by state or provincial governments and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory.\nArticle 903: Affirmation of Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and Other Agreements\nFurther to Article 103 (Relation to Other Agreements), the Parties affirm with respect to each other their existing rights and obligations relating to standards-related measures under the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and all other international agreements, including environmental and conservation agreements, to which those Parties are party.\nArticle 904: Basic Rights and Obligations\nRight to Take Standards-Related Measures\n1. Each Party may, in accordance with this Agreement, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure, including any such measure relating to safety, the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, and any measure to ensure its enforcement or implementation. Such measures include those to prohibit the importation of a good of another Party or the provision of a service by a service provider of another Party that fails to comply with the applicable requirements of those measures or to complete the Party's approval procedures.\nRight to Establish Level of Protection\n2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, each Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives of safety or the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, establish the levels of protection that it considers appropriate in accordance with Article 907(2).\nNon-Discriminatory Treatment\n3. Each Party shall, in respect of its standards-related measures, accord to goods and service providers of another Party:\n\n(a) national treatment in accordance with Article 301 (Market Access) or Article 1202 (Cross-Border Trade in Services); and\n(b) treatment no less favorable than that it accords to like goods, or in like circumstances to service providers, of any other country.\nUnnecessary Obstacles\n4. No Party may prepare, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure with a view to or with the effect of creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties. An unnecessary obstacle to trade shall not be deemed to be created where:\n\n(a) the demonstrable purpose of the measure is to achieve a legitimate objective; and\n(b) the measure does not operate to exclude goods of another Party that meet that legitimate objective.\nArticle 905: Use of International Standards\n1. Each Party shall use, as a basis for its standards-related measures, relevant international standards or international standards whose completion is imminent, except where such standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means to fulfill its legitimate objectives, for example because of fundamental climatic, geographical, technological or infrastructural factors, scientific justification or the level of protection that the Party considers appropriate.\n2. A Party's standards-related measure that conforms to an international standard shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 904(3) and (4).\n3. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, from adopting, maintaining or applying any standards-related measure that results in a higher level of protection than would be achieved if the measure were based on the relevant international standard.\nArticle 906: Compatibility and Equivalence\n1. Recognizing the crucial role of standards-related measures in achieving legitimate objectives, the Parties shall, in accordance with this Chapter, work jointly to enhance the level of safety and of protection of human, animal and plant life and health, the environment and consumers.\n2. Without reducing the level of safety or of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, without prejudice to the rights of any Party under this Chapter, and taking into account international standardization activities, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable, make compatible their respective standards-related measures, so as to facilitate trade in a good or service between the Parties.\n3. Further to Articles 902 and 905, a Party shall, on request of another Party, seek, through appropriate measures, to promote the compatibility of a specific standard or conformity assessment procedure that is maintained in its territory with the standards or conformity assessment procedures maintained in the territory of the other Party.\n4. Each importing Party shall treat a technical regulation adopted or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with the importing Party, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the importing Party that its technical regulation adequately fulfills the importing Party's legitimate objectives.\n5. The importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party, on request, its reasons in writing for not treating a technical regulation as equivalent under paragraph 4.\n6. Each Party shall, wherever possible, accept the results of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of another Party, provided that it is satisfied that the procedure offers an assurance, equivalent to that provided by a procedure it conducts or a procedure conducted in its territory the results of which it accepts, that the relevant good or service complies with the applicable technical regulation or standard adopted or maintained in the Party's territory.\n7. Prior to accepting the results of a conformity assessment procedure pursuant to paragraph 6, and to enhance confidence in the continued reliability of each other's conformity assessment results, the Parties may consult on such matters as the technical competence of the conformity assessment bodies involved, including verified compliance with relevant international standards through such means as accreditation.\nArticle 907: Assessment of Risk\n1. A Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, conduct an assessment of risk. In conducting an assessment, a Party may take into account, among other factors relating to a good or service:\n\n(a) available scientific evidence or technical information;\n(b) intended end uses;\n(c) processes or production, operating, inspection, sampling or testing methods; or\n(d) environmental conditions.\n2. Where pursuant to Article 904(2) a Party establishes a level of protection that it considers appropriate and conducts an assessment of risk, it should avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions between similar goods or services in the level of protection it considers appropriate, where the distinctions:\n\n(a) result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against goods or service providers of another Party;\n(b) constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties; or\n(c) discriminate between similar goods or services for the same use under the same conditions that pose the same level of risk and provide similar benefits.\n3. Where a Party conducting an assessment of risk determines that available scientific evidence or other information is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a provisional technical regulation on the basis of available relevant information. The Party shall, within a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the assessment of risk is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and, where appropriate, revise the provisional technical regulation in the light of that assessment.\nArticle 908: Conformity Assessment\n1. The Parties shall, further to Article 906 and recognizing the existence of substantial differences in the structure, organization and operation of conformity assessment procedures in their respective territories, make compatible those procedures to the greatest extent practicable.\n2. Recognizing that it should be to the mutual advantage of the Parties concerned and except as set out in Annex 908.2, each Party shall accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies in the territory of another Party on terms no less favorable than those accorded to conformity assessment bodies in its territory.\n3. Each Party shall, with respect to its conformity assessment procedures:\n\n(a) not adopt or maintain any such procedure that is stricter, nor apply the procedure more strictly, than necessary to give it confidence that a good or a service conforms with an applicable technical regulation or standard, taking into account the risks that non-conformity would create;\n(b) initiate and complete the procedure as expeditiously as possible;\n(c) in accordance with Article 904(3), undertake processing of applications in non-discriminatory order;\n(d) publish the normal processing period for each such procedure or communicate the anticipated processing period to an applicant on request;\n(e) ensure that the competent body\n\n(i) on receipt of an application, promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of any deficiency,\n(ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible the results of the conformity assessment procedure in a form that is precise and complete so that the applicant may take any necessary corrective action,\n(iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds as far as practicable with the procedure where the applicant so requests, and\n(iv) informs the applicant, on request, of the status of the application and the reasons for any delay;\n(f) limit the information the applicant is required to supply to that necessary to conduct the procedure and to determine appropriate fees;\n(g) accord confidential or proprietary information arising from, or supplied in connection with, the conduct of the procedure for a good of another Party or for a service provided by a person of another Party\n\n(i) the same treatment as that for a good of the Party or a service provided by a person of the Party, and\n(ii) in any event, treatment that protects an applicant's legitimate commercial interests to the extent provided under the Party's law;\n(h) ensure that any fee it imposes for conducting the procedure is no higher for a good of another Party or a service provider of another Party than is equitable in relation to any such fee imposed for its like goods or service providers or for like goods or service providers of any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and other related costs;\n(i) ensure that the location of facilities at which a conformity assessment procedure is conducted does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent;\n(j) limit the procedure, for a good or service modified subsequent to a determination that the good or service conforms to the applicable technical regulation or standard, to that necessary to determine that the good or service continues to conform to the technical regulation or standard; and\n(k) limit any requirement regarding samples of a good to that which is reasonable, and ensure that the selection of samples does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent.\n4. Each Party shall apply, with such modifications as may be necessary, the relevant provisions of paragraph 3 to its approval procedures.\n5. Each Party shall, on request of another Party, take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate access in its territory for conformity assessment activities.\n6. Each Party shall give sympathetic consideration to a request by another Party to negotiate agreements for the mutual recognition of the results of that other Party's conformity assessment procedures.\nArticle 909: Notification, Publication, and Provision of Information\n1. Further to Articles 1802 (Publication) and 1803 (Notification and Provision of Information), each Party proposing to adopt or modify a technical regulation shall:\n\n(a) at least 60 days prior to the adoption or modification of the measure, other than a law, publish a notice and notify in writing the other Parties of the proposed measure in such a manner as to enable interested persons to become acquainted with the proposed measure, except that in the case of any such measure relating to perishable goods, each Party shall, to the greatest extent practicable, publish the notice and provide the notification at least 30 days prior to the adoption or modification of the measure, but no later than when notification is provided to domestic producers;\n(b) identify in the notice and notification the good or service to which the measure would apply, and shall provide a brief description of the objective of, and reasons for the measure;\n(c) provide a copy of the proposed measure to any Party or interested person that so requests, and shall, wherever possible, identify any provision that deviates in substance from relevant international standards; and\n(d) without discrimination, allow other Parties and interested persons to make comments in writing and shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account.\n2. Each Party proposing to adopt or modify a standard or any conformity assessment procedure not otherwise considered to be a technical regulation shall, where an international standard relevant to the proposed measure does not exist or such measure is not substantially the same as an international standard, and where the measure may have a significant effect on the trade of the other Parties:\n\n(a) at an early appropriate stage, publish a notice and provide a notification of the type required in paragraph 1(a) and (b); and\n(b) observe paragraph (c) and (d).\n3. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure, with respect to a technical regulation of a state or provincial government other than a local government:\n\n(a) that, at an early appropriate stage, a notice and notification of the type required under paragraph 1(a) and (b) are made prior to their adoption; and\n(b) observance of paragraph (c) and (d).\n4. Where a Party considers it necessary to address an urgent problem relating to safety or to protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, it may omit any step set out in paragraph 1 or 3, provided that on adoption of a standards-related measure it shall:\n\n(a) immediately provide to the other Parties a notification of the type required under paragraph 1(b), including a brief description of the urgent problem;\n(b) provide a copy of the measure to any Party or interested person that so requests; and\n(c) without discrimination, allow other Parties and interested persons to make comments in writing, and shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account.\n5. Each Party shall, except where necessary to address an urgent problem referred to in paragraph 4, allow a reasonable period between the publication of a standards-related measure and the date that it becomes effective to allow time for interested persons to adapt to the measure.\n6. Where a Party allows non-governmental persons in its territory to be present during the process of development of standards-related measures, it shall also allow non-governmental persons from the territories of the other Parties to be present.\n7. Each Party shall notify the other Parties of the development of, amendment to, or change in the application of its standards-related measures no later than the time at which it notifies non-governmental persons in general or the relevant sector in its territory.\n8. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure the observance of paragraphs 6 and 7 by a state or provincial government, and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory.\n9. Each Party shall designate by January 1, 1994 a government authority responsible for the implementation at the federal level of the notification provisions of this Article, and shall notify the other Parties thereof. Where a Party designates two or more government authorities for that purpose, it shall provide to the other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope of responsibility of each such authority.\nArticle 910: Inquiry Points\n1. Each Party shall ensure that there is an inquiry point that is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from other Parties and interested persons, and to provide relevant documents regarding:\n\n(a) any standards-related measure proposed, adopted or maintained in its territory at the federal, state or provincial government level;\n(b) the membership and participation of the Party, or its relevant federal, state or provincial government authorities, in international and regional standardizing bodies and conformity assessment systems, and in bilateral and multilateral arrangements regarding standards-related measures, and the provisions of those systems and arrangements;\n(c) the location of notices published pursuant to Article 909, or where the information can be obtained;\n(d) the location of the inquiry points referred to in paragraph 3; and\n(e) the Party's procedures for assessment of risk, and factors it considers in conducting the assessment and in establishing, pursuant to Article 904(2), the levels of protection that it considers appropriate.\n2. Where a Party designates more than one inquiry point, it shall:\n\n(a) provide to the other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope of responsibility of each inquiry point; and\n(b) ensure that any inquiry addressed to an incorrect inquiry point is promptly conveyed to the correct inquiry point.\n3. Each Party shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure that there is at least one inquiry point that is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from other Parties and interested persons and to provide relevant documents or information as to where they can be obtained regarding:\n\n(a) any standard or conformity assessment procedure proposed, adopted or maintained by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory; and\n(b) the membership and participation of relevant non-governmental bodies in its territory in international and regional standardizing bodies and conformity assessment systems.\n4. Each Party shall ensure that where copies of documents are requested by another Party or by interested persons in accordance with this Chapter, they are supplied at the same price, apart from the actual cost of delivery, as the price for domestic purchase.\nArticle 911: Technical Cooperation\n1. Each Party shall, on request of another Party:\n\n(a) provide to that Party technical advice, information and assistance on mutually agreed terms and conditions to enhance that Party's standards-related measures, and related activities, processes and systems;\n(b) provide to that Party information on its technical cooperation programs regarding standards-related measures relating to specific areas of interest; and\n(c) consult with that Party during the development of, or prior to the adoption or change in the application of, any standards-related measure.\n2. Each Party shall encourage standardizing bodies in its territory to cooperate with the standardizing bodies in the territories of the other Parties in their participation, as appropriate, in standardizing activities, such as through membership in international standardizing bodies.\nArticle 912: Limitations on the Provision of Information\nNothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a Party to:\n\n(a) communicate, publish texts, or provide particulars or copies of documents other than in an official language of the Party; or\n(b) furnish any information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises.\nArticle 913: Committee on Standards-Related Measures\n1. The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Standards-Related Measures, comprising representatives of each Party.\n2. The Committee's functions shall include:\n\n(a) monitoring the implementation and administration of this Chapter, including the progress of the subcommittees and working groups established under paragraph 4, and the operation of the inquiry points established under Article 910;\n(b) facilitating the process by which the Parties make compatible their standards-related measures;\n(c) providing a forum for the Parties to consult on issues relating to standards-related measures, including the provision of technical advice and recommendations under Article 914;\n(d) enhancing cooperation on the development, application and enforcement of standards-related measures; and\n(e) considering non-governmental, regional and multilateral developments regarding standards-related measures, including under the GATT.\n3. The Committee shall:\n\n(a) meet on request of any Party and, unless the Parties otherwise agree, at least once each year; and\n(b) report annually to the Commission on the implementation of this Chapter.\n4. The Committee may, as it considers appropriate, establish and determine the scope and mandate of subcommittees or working groups, comprising representatives of each Party. Each subcommittee or working group may:\n\n(a) as it considers necessary or desirable, include or consult with\n\n(i) representatives of non-governmental bodies, including standardizing bodies,\n(ii) scientists, and\n(iii) technical experts; and\n(b) determine its work program, taking into account relevant international activities.\n5. Further to paragraph 4, the Committee shall establish:\n\n(a) the following subcommittees\n\n(i) Land Transportation Standards Subcommittee, in accordance with Annex 913.5.a-1,\n(ii) Telecommunications Standards Subcommittee, in accordance with Annex 913.5.a-2,\n(iii) Automotive Standards Council, in accordance with Annex 913.5.a-3, and\n(iv) Subcommittee on Labelling of Textile and Apparel Goods, in accordance with Annex 913.5.a-4; and\n(b) such other subcommittees or working groups as it considers appropriate to address any topic, including:\n\n(i) identification and nomenclature for goods subject to standards-related measures,\n(ii) quality and identity standards and technical regulations,\n(iii) packaging, labelling and presentation of consumer information, including languages, measurement systems, ingredients, sizes, terminology, symbols and related matters,\n(iv) product approval and post-market surveillance programs,\n(v) principles for the accreditation and recognition of conformity assessment bodies, procedures and systems,\n(vi) development and implementation of a uniform chemical hazard classification and communication system,\n(vii) enforcement programs, including training and inspections by regulatory, analytical and enforcement personnel,\n(viii) promotion and implementation of good laboratory practices,\n(ix) promotion and implementation of good manufacturing practices,\n(x) criteria for assessment of potential environmental hazards of goods,\n(xi) methodologies for assessment of risk,\n(xii) guidelines for testing of chemicals, including industrial and agricultural chemicals, pharmaceuticals and biologicals,\n(xiii) methods by which consumer protection, including matters relating to consumer redress, can be facilitated, and\n(xiv) extension of the application of this Chapter to other services.\n6.

A Party requesting technical advice, information or assistance pursuant to Article 911 shall notify the Committee which shall facilitate any such request.\nArticle 914: Technical Consultations\n1. Where a Party requests consultations regarding the application of this Chapter to a standards-related measure, and so notifies the Committee, the Committee may facilitate the consultations, if it does not consider the matter itself, by referring the matter for non-binding technical advice or recommendations to a subcommittee or working group, including an ad hoc subcommittee or working group, or to another forum.\n2. The Committee should consider any matter referred to it under paragraph 1 as expeditiously as possible and promptly forward to the Parties any technical advice or recommendations that it develops or receives concerning the matter. The Parties involved shall provide a written response to the Committee concerning the technical advice or recommendations within such time as the Committee may request.\n3. Where the involved Parties have had recourse to consultations facilitated by the Committee under paragraph 1, the consultations shall, on the agreement of the Parties involved, constitute consultations under Article 2006 (Consultations).\n4. The Parties confirm that a Party asserting that a standards-related measure of another Party is inconsistent with this Chapter shall have the burden of establishing the inconsistency.\nArticle 915: Definitions\n1.

So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress and congratulating you, Mr. Speaker.\nIf we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994. And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992.\nI must say that in both years we didn't hear America singing, we heard America shouting. And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must say, \"We hear you. We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us. For we are the keepers of a sacred trust, and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era.\"\nOver 200 years ago, our Founders changed the entire course of human history by joining together to create a new country based on a single powerful idea: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, . . . endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, and among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\nIt has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea, the American idea, and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times: to Lincoln and to his Congress to preserve the Union and to end slavery; to Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to restrain the abuses and excesses of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world; to Franklin Roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the Great Depression and to win our country's great struggle against fascism; and to all our Presidents since to fight the cold war. Especially, I recall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with Congresses where the majority was of a different party: to Harry Truman, who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the architecture of the cold war; and to Ronald Reagan, whom we wish well tonight and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against communism was won.\nIn another time of change and challenge, I had the honor to be the first President to be elected in the post-cold-war era, an era marked by the global economy, the information revolution, unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for the American people. I came to this hallowed Chamber 2 years ago on a mission, to restore the American dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world. I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored. In this effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes, and I have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor. But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was 2 years ago. Thank you.\nRecord numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global economy. We are at peace, and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world. We have almost 6 million new jobs since I became President, and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. Our businesses are more productive. And here we have worked to bring the deficit down, to expand trade, to put more police on our streets, to give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities.\nBut the rising tide is not lifting all boats. While our Nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our people are still working harder and harder, for less and less. While our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and competitive, too many of our people still can't be sure of having a job next year or even next month. And far more than our material riches are threatened, things far more precious to us, our children, our families, our values.\nOur civil life is suffering in America today. Citizens are working together less and shouting at each other more. The common bonds of community which have been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed. What are we to do about it?\nMore than 60 years ago, at the dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt told our Nation, \"New conditions impose new requirements on Government and those who conduct Government.\" And from that simple proposition, he shaped the New Deal, which helped to restore our Nation to prosperity and define the relationship between our people and their Government for half a century.\nThat approach worked in its time. But we today, we face a very different time and very different conditions. We are moving from an industrial age built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility. Our Government, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen by many as simply a captive of narrow interests, putting more burdens on our citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead. The values that used to hold us all together seem to be coming apart.\nSo tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of understandings, not just with Government but, even more important, with one another as Americans.\nThat's what I want to talk with you about tonight. I call it the New Covenant. But it's grounded in a very, very old idea, that all Americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their God-given talents and determination can take them and to give something back to their communities and their country in return. Opportunity and responsibility: They go hand in hand. We can't have one without the other. And our national community can't hold together without both.\nOur New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our people to meet the challenges of a new economy, how we can change the way our Government works to fit a different time, and, above all, how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common purpose. We must have dramatic change in our economy, our Government, and ourselves.\nMy fellow Americans, without regard to party, let us rise to the occasion. Let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride. As we embark on this new course, let us put our country first, remembering that regardless of party label, we are all Americans. And let the final test of everything we do be a simple one: Is it good for the American people?\nLet me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not better servants. You made a good start by passing that law which applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector, and I was proud to sign it yesterday. But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work around here. Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors of Washington as were here 20 years ago. The American people look at their Capital, and they see a city where the well-connected and the well-protected can work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left out.\nAs the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still doing business as usual; the gifts, the trips, all the things that people are concerned about haven't stopped. Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices. I know there were other considerations in those votes, but I want to use something that I've heard my Republican friends say from time to time, \"There doesn't have to be a law for everything.\" So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists' perks. Just stop. We don't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the American people that things are really changing. But I also hope you will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill, and I'll sign that, too.\nWe should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what they're spending, what they want. We should also curb the role of big money in elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of PAC's. And as I have said for 3 years, we should work to open the airwaves so that they can be an instrument of democracy, not a weapon of destruction, by giving free TV time to candidates for public office.\nWhen the last Congress killed political reform last year, it was reported in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the Halls of this sacred building and cheered. This year, let's give the folks at home something to cheer about.\nMore important, I think we all agree that we have to change the way the Government works. Let's make it smaller, less costly, and smarter; leaner, not meaner.\nI just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine is alive and well.\nThe New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter. The old way of governing around here protected organized interests. We should look out for the interests of ordinary people. The old way divided us by interest, constituency, or class. The New Covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of what's best for our country. The old way dispensed services through large, top-down, inflexible bureaucracies. The New Covenant way should shift these resources and decisionmaking from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy. The old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure. The New Covenant way should have built-in incentives to reward success. The old way was centralized here in Washington. The New Covenant way must take hold in the communities all across America. And we should help them to do that.\nOur job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy, to empower people to make the most of their own lives, and to enhance our security here at home and abroad. We must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves. We should rely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for each other.\nI hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters, we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is somehow a program for every problem, on the one hand, and the other illusion that the Government is a source of every problem we have. Our job is to get rid of yesterday's Government so that our own people can meet today's and tomorrow's needs. And we ought to do it together.\nYou know, for years before I became President, I heard others say they would cut Government and how bad it was, but not much happened. We actually did it. We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending, more than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions from the Federal bureaucracy in the last 2 years alone. Based on decisions already made, we will have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million positions from the Federal Government, making it the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was President, by the time I come here again next year.\nUnder the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have already saved taxpayers $63 billion. The age of the $500 hammer and the ashtray you can break on \"David Letterman\" is gone. Deadwood programs, like mohair subsidies, are gone. We've streamlined the Agriculture Department by reducing it by more than 1,200 offices. We've slashed the small business loan form from an inch thick to a single page. We've thrown away the Government's 10,000-page personnel manual.\nAnd the Government is working better in important ways: FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has gone from being a disaster to helping people in disasters. You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or the people in California who have dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires, and they'll tell you that. Government workers, working hand in hand with private business, rebuilt southern California's fractured freeways in record time and under budget. And because the Federal Government moved fast, all but one of the 5,600 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business.\nNow, there are a lot of other things that I could talk about. I want to just mention one because it will be discussed here in the next few weeks. University administrators all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable with better repayment terms for students, costs the Government less, and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the Government and for the universities. We shouldn't cap that program. We should give every college in America the opportunity to be a part of it.\nPrevious Government programs gathered dust. The reinventing Government report is getting results. And we're not through. There's going to be a second round of reinventing Government. We propose to cut $130 billion in spending by shrinking departments, extending our freeze on domestic spending, cutting 60 public housing programs down to 3, getting rid of over 100 programs we do not need, like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program. And we're working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more sensible. The programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should go. We have to cut yesterday's Government to help solve tomorrow's problems.\nAnd we need to get Government closer to the people it's meant to serve. We need to help move programs down to the point where States and communities and private citizens in the private sector can do a better job. If they can do it, we ought to let them do it. We should get out of the way and let them do what they can do better. Taking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for.\nIt's time for Congress to stop passing on to the States the cost of decisions we make here in Washington. I know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded mandates legislation, but I want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interests and give justified relief where we need to give it.\nFor years, Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending projects. Last year was no difference. There was a $1 million to study stress in plants and $12 million for a tick removal program that didn't work. It's hard to remove ticks. Those of us who have had them know. But I'll tell you something, if you'll give me line-item veto, I'll remove some of that unnecessary spending.\nBut I think we should all remember, and almost all of us would agree, that Government still has important responsibilities. Our young people—we should think of this when we cut—our young people hold our future in their hands. We still owe a debt to our veterans. And our senior citizens have made us what we are. Now, my budget cuts a lot. But it protects education, veterans, Social Security, and Medicare, and I hope you will do the same thing. You should, and I hope you will.\nAnd when we give more flexibility to the States, let us remember that there are certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every State, North and South, East and West: Immunization against childhood disease, school lunches in all our schools, Head Start, medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants, all these things, all these things are in the national interest.\nI applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations. But when we deregulate, let's remember what national action in the national interest has given us: safer food for our families, safer toys for our children, safer nursing homes for our parents, safer cars and highways, and safer workplaces, cleaner air, and cleaner water. Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations? You bet we do. But we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water. We can have fairness and still clean up toxic dumps, and we ought to do it.\nShould we cut the deficit more? Well, of course we should. Of course we should. But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic recovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished but instead should be helped.\nI know many of you in this Chamber support the balanced budget amendment. I certainly want to balance the budget. Our administration has done more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very, very long time. If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do, then you have to be straight with the American people. They have a right to know what you're going to cut, what taxes you're going to raise, and how it's going to affect them. We should be doing things in the open around here. For example, everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social Security. I would oppose that, and I think most Americans would.\nNothing has done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our failed welfare system. This is one of the problems we have to face here in Washington in our New Covenant. It rewards welfare over work. It undermines family values. It lets millions of parents get away without paying their child support. It keeps a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time.\nI've worked on this problem for a long time, nearly 15 years now. As a Governor, I had the honor of working with the Reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988. In the last 2 years, we made a good start at continuing the work of welfare reform. Our administration gave two dozen States the right to slash through Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency.\nLast year I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by an administration. We have to make welfare what it was meant to be, a second chance, not a way of life. We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible, to provide child care and teach them skills, if that's what they need, for up to 2 years. And after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule: Anyone who can work must go to work. If a parent isn't paying child support, they should be forced to pay. We should suspend drivers' license, track them across State lines, make them work off what they owe. That is what we should do. Governments do not raise children, people do. And the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world.\nI want to work with you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform. But our goal must be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to independence, from welfare to work, from mere childbearing to responsible parenting. Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor.\nWe should, we should require work and mutual responsibility. But we shouldn't cut people off just because they're poor, they're young, or even because they're unmarried. We should promote responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised settings, by requiring them to finish school. But we shouldn't put them and their children out on the street. And I know all the arguments, pro and con, and I have read and thought about this for a long time. I still don't think we can in good conscience punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.\nMy fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the American people care about this without regard to party or race or region. So let this be the year we end welfare as we know it. But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue to divide America. No one is more eager to end welfareI may be the only President who has actually had the opportunity to sit in a welfare office, who's actually spent hours and hours talking to people on welfare. And I am telling you, the people who are trapped on it know it doesn't work; they also want to get off. So we can promote, together, education and work and good parenting. I have no problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent. I just don't want to punish poverty and past mistakes. All of us have made our mistakes, and none of us can change our yesterdays. But every one of us can change our tomorrows. And America's best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey, who worked her way off welfare to become a Congresswoman from the State of California.\nI know the Members of this Congress are concerned about crime, as are all the citizens of our country. And I remind you that last year we passed a very tough crime bill: longer sentences, \"three strikes and you're out,\" almost 60 new capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention, 100,000 more police. And we paid for it all by reducing the size of the Federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower the crime rate.\nThere may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be smarter with crime, to help to lower that rate first. Well, if there are, let's talk about them, and let's do them. But let's not go back on the things that we did last year that we know work, that we know work because the local law enforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing, because local community leaders who have worked for years and years to lower the crime rate tell us that they work. Let's look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it. And if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate—and I am convinced that it does—let us not go back on it. Let's stick with it, implement it. We've got 4 more hard years of work to do to do that.\nI don't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight, but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly last year. The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and, in the crime bill, the ban on 19 assault weapons. I don't think it's a secret to anybody in this room that several Members of the last Congress who voted for that aren't here tonight because they voted for it. And I know, therefore, that some of you who are here because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it. I just have to tell you how I feel about it.\nThe Members of Congress who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activities. I've done it since I was a boy, and I'm going to keep right on doing it until I can't do it anymore. But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of assault weapon attack, and I will not let that be repealed. I will not let it be repealed.\nI'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with. I want us to cut more spending, but I hope we won't cut Government programs that help to prepare us for the new economy, promote responsibility, and are organized from the grassroots up, not by Federal bureaucracy. The very best example of this is the national service corps, AmeriCorps. It passed with strong bipartisan support. And now there are 20,000 Americans, more than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps, working all over this country, helping people person-to-person in local grassroots volunteer groups, solving problems, and in the process earning some money for their education. This is citizenship at its best. It's good for the AmeriCorps members, but it's good for the rest of us, too. It's the essence of the New Covenant, and we shouldn't stop it.\nAll Americans, not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens. In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.\nThe most important job of our Government in this new era is to empower the American people to succeed in the global economy. America has always been a land of opportunity, a land where, if you work hard, you can get ahead. We've become a great middle class country. Middle class values sustain us. We must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass, even as we do everything we can to support the millions of Americans who are already successful in the new economy.\nAmerica is once again the world's strongest economic power: almost 6 million new jobs in the last 2 years, exports booming, inflation down. High-wage jobs are coming back. A record number of American entrepreneurs are living the American dream. If we want it to stay that way, those who work and lift our Nation must have more of its benefits.\nToday, too many of those people are being left out. They're working harder for less. They have less security, less income, less certainty that they can even afford a vacation, much less college for their kids or retirement for themselves. We cannot let this continue. If we don't act, our economy will probably keep doing what it's been doing since about 1978, when the income growth began to go to those at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle got very little growth, and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then fell even further and further behind in the years afterward, no matter how hard they worked.\nWe've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this new economy work for all of our people, a Government that helps each and every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skills. That's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the last 2 years, from Head Start to public schools, to apprenticeships for young people who don't go to college, to making college loans more available and more affordable. That's the first thing we have to do. We've got to do something to empower people to improve their skills.\nThe second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes immediately by lowering their taxes. We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million families with incomes under $27,000, a tax cut that this year will average about $1,000 a family. And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses. Before we could do more than that, we first had to bring down the deficit we inherited, and we had to get economic growth up. Now we've done both. And now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way. But tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation: to empower our citizens through education and training to make the most of their own lives. The spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for themselves, their families, and their communities.\nI have proposed the middle class bill of rights, which should properly be called the bill of rights and responsibilities because its provisions only benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to educate themselves. It will, therefore, give needed tax relief and raise incomes in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefits all of us.\nThere are four provisions. First, a tax deduction for all education and training after high school. If you think about it, we permit businesses to deduct their investment, we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages, but today an education is even more important to the economic well-being of our whole country than even those things are. We should do everything we can to encourage it. And I hope you will support it. Second, we ought to cut taxes $500 for families with children under 13. Third, we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by permitting people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education, health care, first-time homebuying, or the care of a parent. And fourth, we should pass a GI bill for America's workers. We propose to collapse nearly 70 Federal programs and not give the money to the States but give the money directly to the American people, offer vouchers to them so that they, if they're laid off or if they're working for a very low wage, can get a voucher worth $2,600 a year for up to 2 years to go to their local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills they need to improve their lives. Let's empower people in this way, move it from the Government directly to the workers of America.\nNow, any one of us can call for a tax cut, but I won't accept one that explodes the deficit or puts our recovery at risk. We ought to pay for our tax cuts fully and honestly.\nJust 2 years ago, it was an open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit. Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then, many of whom didn't return, we did cut the deficit. We began to do what others said would not be done. We cut the deficit by over $600 billion, about $10,000 for every family in this country. It's coming down 3 years in a row for the first time since Mr. Truman was President, and I don't think anybody in America wants us to let it explode again.\nIn the budget I will send you, the middle class bill of rights is fully paid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy, cuts in programs, cuts in special interest subsidies. And the spending cuts will more than double the tax cuts. My budget pays for the middle class bill of rights without any cuts in Medicare. And I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with Medicare cuts. That's not the right thing to do.\nI know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief, and some of them I find quite interesting. I really want to work with all of you. My test for our proposals will be: Will it create jobs and raise incomes; will it strengthen our families and support our children; is it paid for; will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass? If it does, I'll support it. But if it doesn't, I won't.\nThe goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is also why I believe that you should raise the minimum wage. It rewards work. Two and a half million Americans, two and a half million Americans, often women with children, are working out there today for $4.25 an hour. In terms of real buying power, by next year that minimum wage will be at a 40-year low. That's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work.\nNow, I've studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum wage increase. I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market. But the most important thing is, you can't make a living on $4.25 an hour, especially if you have children, even with the working families tax cut we passed last year. In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue, and I think it should be again. So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on this, to get together, to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage.\nMembers of Congress have been here less than a month, but by the end of the week, 28 days into the new year, every Member of Congress will have earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker makes all year long.\nEverybody else here, including the President, has something else that too many Americans do without, and that's health care. Now, last year we almost came to blows over health care, but we didn't do anything. And the cold, hard fact is that, since last year, since I was here, another 1.1 million Americans in working families have lost their health care. And the cold, hard fact is that many millions more, most of them farmers and small business people and self-employed people, have seen their premiums skyrocket, their copays and deductibles go up. There's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have health insurance but really what they've got is a piece of paper that says they won't lose their home if they get sick.\nNow, I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health security for every American family. But I know that last year, as the evidence indicates, we bit off more than we could chew. So I'm asking you that we work together. Let's do it step by step. Let's do whatever we have to do to get something done. Let's at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage for facing skyrocketing prices, that nobody loses their coverage because they face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or lose a job or a family member gets sick.\nI want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this, with the Democrats who worked on it last time, with the Republican leaders like Senator Dole, who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made some constructive proposals in this area last year. We ought to make sure that self-employed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools. We ought to help families provide long-term care for a sick parent or a disabled child. We can work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work. And we can find a way—it may take some time, but we can find a way—to make sure that our children have health care.\nYou know, I think everybody in this room, without regard to party, can be proud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world's most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade. But we can't be proud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the world that has a smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health insurance today than we did 10 years ago, the last time we were the most productive economy in the world. So let's work together on this. It is too important for politics as usual.\nMuch of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we've already talked about. A lot of people think that the security concerns of America today are entirely internal to our borders. They relate to the security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children, our streets, our health, and protecting those borders. Now that the cold war has passed, it's tempting to believe that all the security issues, with the possible exception of trade, reside here at home. But it's not so. Our security still depends upon our continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy. We still can't be strong at home unless we're strong abroad.\nThe financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point. I know it's not popular to say it tonight, but we have to act, not for the Mexican people but for the sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to Mexico's well-being. If we want to secure American jobs, preserve American exports, safeguard America's borders, then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put Mexico back on track.\nNow let me repeat: It's not a loan; it's not foreign aid; it's not a bailout. We will be given a guarantee like cosigning a note, with good collateral that will cover our risks. This legislation is the right thing for America. That's why the bipartisan leadership has supported it. And I hope you in Congress will pass it quickly. It is in our interest, and we can explain it to the American people because we're going to do it in the right way.\nYou know, tonight, this is the first State of the Union Address ever delivered since the beginning of the cold war when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America. And along with the Russians, we're on our way to destroying the missiles and the bombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads. We've come so far so fast in this post-cold-war world that it's easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for granted. But it's still there, and we aren't finished yet.\nThis year I'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons that carry 5,000 more warheads. The United States will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical weapons. To stop and roll back North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear program, we'll continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation. It's smart. It's tough. It's a deal based on continuing inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves.\nThis year I'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home or abroad. As the cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out, this country will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice.\nJust this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and injured scores more. On behalf of the American people and all of you, I send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in the face of such evil, it is hard for the people in the Middle East to go forward. But the terrorists represent the past, not the future. We must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors in the Middle East.\nAccordingly, last night I signed an Executive order that will block the assets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the peace process. It prohibits financial transactions with these groups. And tonight I call on all our allies and peace-loving nations throughout the world to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism. We cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and paralysis.\nFrom the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our Nation would maintain the best equipped, best trained, and best prepared military on Earth. We have, and they are. They have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit. But to make sure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their families deserve, I'm asking the Congress to add $25 billion in defense spending over the next 6 years.\nI have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became President. Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction. We ask a very great deal of our Armed Forces. Now that they are smaller in number, we ask more of them. They go out more often to more different places and stay longer. They are called to service in many, many ways. And we must give them and their families what the times demand and what they have earned.\nJust think about what our troops have done in the last year, showing America at its best, helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda, moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait, giving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti. We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South Africa to Northern Ireland, from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia, from Latin America to the Middle East. All these endeavors are good in those places, but they make our future more confident and more secure.\nWell, my fellow Americans, that's my agenda for America's future: expanding opportunity, not bureaucracy; enhancing security at home and abroad; empowering our people to make the most of their own lives. It's ambitious and achievable, but it's not enough. We even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping Americans to compete in the new economy, more than a Government that's smaller, smarter, and wiser, more than all of the changes we can make in Government and in the private sector from the outside in.\nOur fortunes and our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer some questions from within, from the values and voices that speak to our hearts as well as our heads; voices that tell us we have to do more to accept responsibility for ourselves and our families, for our communities, and yes, for our fellow citizens. We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart, and we feel the common ground shifting from under us. The PTA, the town hall meeting, the ball park, it's hard for a lot of overworked parents to find the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation. Too many of our children don't even have parents and grandparents who can give them those experiences that they need to build their own character and their sense of identity.\nWe all know what while we here in this Chamber can make a difference on those things, that the real differences will be made by our fellow citizens, where they work and where they live and that it will be made almost without regard to party. When I used to go to the softball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter's league, and people would come up to me, fathers and mothers, and talk to me, I can honestly say I had no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or Democrats. When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California, northern California, last week, a woman came up to me and did something that very few of you would do. She hugged me and said, \"Mr. President, I'm a Republican, but I'm glad you're here.\"\nNow, why? We can't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every day, because as we move into this next century, everybody matters. We don't have a person to waste. And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to do better. That means that we need a New Covenant for everybody.\nFor our corporate and business leaders, we're going to work here to keep bringing the deficit down, to expand markets, to support their success in every possible way. But they have an obligation when they're doing well to keep jobs in our communities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate.\nFor people in the entertainment industry in this country, we applaud your creativity and your worldwide success, and we support your freedom of expression. But you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant, repetitive, mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media all the time.\nWe've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to help us stop our most serious social problem, the epidemic of teen pregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I have sent to Congress a plan to target schools all over this country with antipregnancy programs that work. But Government can only do so much. Tonight I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference. We can do this, and we must.\nAnd I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders. You know, I'm proud of the fact the United States has more houses of worship per capita than any country in the world. These people who lead our houses of worship can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action, can reach out to all of our children, to all of the people in distress, to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear. Because so much of what must be done must come from the inside out and our religious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference, they have a role in the New Covenant as well.\nThere must be more responsibility for all of our citizens. You know, it takes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets and in school. It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity houses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin. It takes a lot of people to provide the people power for all of the civic organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were kids. It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be.\nI know it's hard when you're working harder for less, when you're under great stress to do these things. A lot of our people don't have the time or the emotional stress, they think, to do the work of citizenship.\nMost of us in politics haven't helped very much. For years, we've mostly treated citizens like they were consumers or spectators, sort of political couch potatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads either promise them something for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations. And more and more of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive ways that are hardly conducive to honest and open conversations. But the truth is, we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different views.\nIf you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of America, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago, has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And in this day, everybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply cannot want for a tornado, a fire, or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another.\nI want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the First Lady that represent what I'm trying to talk about—citizens. I have no idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last election. But they represent what we ought to be doing.\nCindy Perry teaches second graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural Kentucky. She gains when she gives. She's a mother of four. She says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency last year. She was married when she was a teenager—stand up, Cindy. She was married when she was a teenager. She had four children. But she had time to serve other people, to get her high school equivalency, and she's going to use her AmeriCorps money to go back to college.\nChief Stephen Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City. He's been a national leader—stand up, Steve. He's been a national leader in using more police in community policing, and he's worked with AmeriCorps to do it. And the crime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he did.\nCorporal Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country's force to help secure democracy in his native land. And I might add, we must be the only country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken Haitian-Americans there who could speak the language and talk to the people. And he was one of them, and we're proud of him.\nThe next two folks I've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a little bit, the Reverend John and the Reverend Diana Cherry of the AME Zion Church in Temple Hills, Maryland. I'd like to ask them to stand. I want to tell you about them. In the early eighties, they left Government service and formed a church in a small living room in a small house, in the early eighties. Today that church has 17,000 members. It is one of the three or four biggest churches in the entire United States. It grows by 200 a month. They do it together. And the special focus of their ministry is keeping families together.\nTwo things they did make a big impression on me. I visited their church once, and I learned they were building a new sanctuary closer to the Washington, DC, line in a higher crime, higher drug rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them. The second thing I want to say is that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House with some other religious leaders, and he left early to go back to this church to minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all over America to convince them to come back together, to save their marriages, and to raise their kids. This is the kind of work that citizens are doing in America. We need more of it, and it ought to be lifted up and supported.\nThe last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Jack, would you stand up? Fifty years ago, in the sands of Iwo Jima, Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship. On February 20th, 1945, he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them. In that moment, he saved the lives of his companions, and miraculously in the next instant, a medic saved his life. He gained a foothold for freedom, and at the age of 17, just a year older than his grandson who is up there with him today—and his son, who is a West Point graduate and a veteran—at 17, Jack Lucas became the youngest Marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor. All these years later, yesterday, here's what he said about that day: \"It didn't matter where you were from or who you were, you relied on one another. You did it for your country.\"\nWe all gain when we give, and we reap what we sow. That's at the heart of this New Covenant. Responsibility, opportunity, and citizenship, more than stale chapters in some remote civic book, they're still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the enduring dream from that first and most sacred covenant. I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our Creator the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This is a very, very great country. And our best days are still to come.\nThank you, and God bless you all.\n","Ohh. Mmm.\nHi.\nHey, you have got to try this cheesecake.\nOh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I—\nIt was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.\nChandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.\nI—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.\nWhy, why not?\nBecause it's too delicious.\nChandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.\nNo-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, I feel terrible, I’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.\nOh, I’m sorry what?\nAll right, I should get going, big day a work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.\nSo…\nAh-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just not my character that’s not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?\nAbsolutely!\nI’ll see you at 8:00.\nOkay.\nOh, what’s at 8:00?\nOh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.\nWow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?\nDuly noted.\nThanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?\nWhat are you talking about?\nCousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night.\nYou were invited?!\nNo.\nMy God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!\nWell, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends.\nWell l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.\nYeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’t have stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go too.\nY’know, she tried to undress me too.\nI used to undress my cousin Glenn.\nJoseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!\nUmm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?\nWell, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.\nBig Daddy?\nOh that’s a nickname we were trying out.\nHey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!\nHey!\nOh! Here’s Joseph Francis!\nOh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!\nSo what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!\nHey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!\nPhoebe he’s right, that is the rule.\nI don’t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!\nWow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.\nWell, it does.\nOkay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!\nOkay, you wore me down.\nHey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?\nThe Ross—Is that back?!!\nHi!\nAnother cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!\nSo just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?\nI can’t seem to say goodbye.\nAre you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?\nWell I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!\nIt was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling… Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!\nY’know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.\nYeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.\nGood idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?\nMomma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.\nAwww! Mel Torme died.\nJoey, that paper’s like a year old!\nAw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!\nHey.\nHey.\nHey.\nSo I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall.\nLimited seating?! I am just one tiny person!\nWell yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.\nLimited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That’s not the reason she’s not inviting me!\nOh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.\nJoan?\nYeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!\nWait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and you got \"and guest?!\"\nUh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…\nNot broad backed!\nWait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!\nWhat? I can’t cancel on Joan!\nWhy not?!\nBec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?\nBecause! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’re family y’know? Well that’s important to me.\nOkay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan.\nAww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.\nWe’ll see.\nWell, thank you for lunch.\nWhat? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!\nSo apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?Mrs. Braverman must be out.\nShe could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.\nBy then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.\nNo that could kill her.\nWell, we don’t want that.\nNo so we’re protecting her.\nBut we should take it.\nBut we should move quick.\nWhy?\nBecause I think I just heard her moving around in there.\nGo! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!\nOh my God! That’s David!\nDavid who?\nDavid the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!\nOh my God!\nOh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around.\nPhoebe?\nDavid! What-what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia?\nYeah, I’m just, I’m just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!\nWell… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?\nYeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.\nYeah.\nUmm, look I-I-I got a confession to make…\nUh-huh.\nUh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn’t know whether I should call or not, y’know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y’know, I didn’t want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and—but I didn’t know if you wanted to see me.\nWell, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you all the time.\nReally? Because I think about you all the time.\nReally?\nI mean, there’s a statue in Minsk…\nUh-huh.\nThat reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it’s actually of Lenin. But, y’know at certain angles…\nYeah.\nUmm, anyway…Do you want to have dinner tonight?\nYes! Oh no!\nOh. Uh, what?\nI can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though?\nUh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y’know, next time you’re in Minsk umm…\nPhoebe, can I talk to you for a second?\nUh-huh.\nWhat are you doing?\nWell, I have plans with Joey tonight.\nSo! He’ll understand!\nNo he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have my principles, I don’t have anything!\nGod, you are so strong.\nOr! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!\nOh my God! That is so good!\nI’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regret it.\nHey!\nHey!\nWhat do you got there?\nOh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some?\nWhat are you doing tonight?\nHuh? Uh…\nDude! Dude!\nOh! Sorry. Uh, I’ve got those plans with Phoebe, why?\nOh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.\nWhat?! Tonight?!\nThat’s what Monica said.\nAfter she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!\nOh here, I think this is us. Yeah.\nLimited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut. Hi!\nHi!\nI’m Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?\nOh, I used to work with Frannie.\nUsed to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!\nStop saying, \"Blood\" to strangers.\nSo, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?\nWe went to college with both of them and now we live next door.\nOkay, you’re fine.\nHey!\nHey!\nAre you guys ready?\nYes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s fine.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nAnd for you sir?\nYeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here?\nIt’s uh, it’s already been roasted.\nOhh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.\nOh Joey, we’ve heard the specials three times! Okay? There’s prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.\nActually we’re out of the lobster ravioli.\nOh well, that changes everything! Y’know what Pheebs?\nHuh?\nYou were right before. I mean, friends are so important.\nYeah, I’m very wise. I know.\nY’know-y’know what I really want?\nWhat?\nIs to have a long, long talk. Y’know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.\nAny progress?\nYes! I will have the lobster ravioli.\nGod Joey, this is taking forever!\nWhat’s the rush? What?\nW-w—I just—it’s that—I have—y’know I have-I have an appointment. And it’s very important.\nWhoa-whoa, what is it?\nWell… It’s a date.\nA date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!\nCome on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.\nNo, I’m gonna!! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!\nThat—It’s not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he’s very special to me.\nOkay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!\nShe was?\nWell, she graduated from high school!\nOkay, whatever. Y’know what? I don’t have time have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him!\nFine!\nYeah!\nFine!\nYeah!\nWhat are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!\nHey!\nHey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn’t think you were coming.\nOh, I wouldn’t miss this.\nWell, I’m very glad you’re here.\nOh, you’re such a gentleman.\nAre you eating the cheesecake without me?!I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!\nOh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!\nY’know what? I don’t trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I’m takin’ it back!\nWhat?! What?!\nOh yes!\nWait a minute!\nOh yes!\nOh no-no-no-no-no, no you don’t!\nOh yes! Oh yes!\nYou think I trust you with it?! No! We’re gonna split it! You take half and I take half!\nWell that’s not fair, you’ve already had some!\nWhat? Oh, well then y’know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.\nWhat do we use to split it?\nOkay! All right, pick a half.\nOkay well, this side looks bigger. Uh… There’s more crust on this side. Y’know? So, maybe if I measured…\nOh for God sake just pick a piece!\nAll right, I’ll pick that one.\nThat’s also the smaller piece. Oh!!!!\nOhhh!\nOkay, you gotta give me some of your piece.\nOh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don’t come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my…\nRoss, sweetheart!\nOh, hey Aunt Millie.\nIsn’t it a beautiful wedding?!\nYes, yes it is. It’s uh… Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!\nHere’s Frannie. Hmm, won’t she be happy to see me?\nNow wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.\nFrannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.\nThat bitch!\nMonica! What…\nAm I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!\nHi Frannie, congratulations.\nYou invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What—Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!\nI believe you know my husband.\nSo it’s really a question of who could you have possibly done.\nOh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can’t miss my flight.\nAre you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like…\nJuly. Umm,\nThat’s really beautiful. What does it mean?\nPlease, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.\nThat’s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.\nYeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.\nYou’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.\nI-I do though.\nI do too.\nBye Phoebe.\nOkay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.\nNo! No! No Pheebs, I’m not gonna yell at you. I just y’know, started thinking about you and David and I…remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just… Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?\nNo I’m not okay. The only guy I’ve ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never…I may never see him again.\nHey, y’know you could always visit him.\nOh right, like they’re gonna let me have a passport.\nAnything I can do? Whatever you need.\nWell—But—Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back.\nI can give it a shot.\nOh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!\nStick to your side!\nHey, come on now!\nOh wait I forgot my wrap.\nWhat? Oh, okay. Wait here.\nHi sweetie! Are you leaving?\nWell…\nGive us a kiss. Come on! Come on!\nWhy?! Why on the lips?!\n","\nGood Evening (sirens in the background)\nI'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard\nWhere many excited fans have gathered with candles\n(crowd starts chanting \"Tupac\")\nAwaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz\nThis is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac\nWhich, raises the question\nWhere are these songs coming from?\nIt's interesting how, the message in these songs\nIs still relevant today\nEven in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics\nI can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight\nWhen the album will officially be released\nOh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now\n\nA coward dies a thousand deaths\nA soldier dies but once\n\nThey say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols\nPlotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you\nPicturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas\nPuffin weed as I position myself to clock G's\nMy enemies scatter in suicidal situations\nNever to witness the wicked shit that they was facing\nPockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches\nEvading the player hating tricks, while hitting switches\nBitches is bad-mouth, cause brawling motherfuckers is bold\nBut y'all some hoes, the game should be sewed\nI'm sick of psychotic society somebody save me\nAddicted to drama so even mama couldn't raise me\nEven the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me\nI run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps\nI'm ducking the cop, I hit the weed as I'm clutching my glock\nNiggas is hot when I hit the block, what if I die tonight\n\nIf I die tonight\nIf I die tonight\nIf I die tonight\n\"Tonight's the night I get in some shit\"\n\nPolishing pistols prepare for battle pass the pump\nWhen I get to popping niggas is dropping then they done\nCalling the coroner come collect the fucking corpse\nHe got it by killer, preoccupied with being boss\nRevenge is the method, whenever stepping keep a weapon close\nAdversaries are overdosed over deadly notes\nJealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails\nHit the block and fill your pockets making crack sales\nPicture perfection pursuing paper with a passion\nVisions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted\nRunning with criminals individuals with no remorse\nTry to stop me my pistol posse's using deadly force\nIn my brain all I can think about is fame\nThe police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed\nI'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers\nConversatin' like they still here, if I die tonight\n\n\nPussy and paper is poetry power and pistols\nPlotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you\nPray to the heavens three-fifty-sevens to the sky\nAnd I hope I'm forgiven for Thug Living when I die\nI wonder if heaven got a ghetto for Thug niggas\nA stress free life and a spot for drug dealers\nPissing while practicing how to pimp and be a player\nOverdose of a dick, while drinking liquor when I lay her\nPistol whipping these simps, for being petrified and lame\nDisrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain\nGoing insane, never die, live eternal, who shall I fear?\nDon't shed a tear for me nigga I ain't happy here\nI hope they bury me and send me to my rest\nHeadlines reading murdered to death, my last breath\nTake a look picture a crook on his last stand\nMotherfuckers don't understand, if I die tonight\n\n\nCan you picture my prophecy?\nStress in the city, the cops is hot for me\nThe projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin\nThere ain't no stoppin me\nConstantly movin while makin millions\nWitnessin killings, leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings\nCarries to children cause they're illin\nAddicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin\nWithout feelin, but will they last or be blasted?\nHard headed bastard\nMaybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath\nMore bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry\nThey're relocating to the cemetary\nGot me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried\nThe question is will I live?

About the second day out of school, I discovered some LSD at 9 AM in the morning. Whether I had eaten breakfast or not I don't remember, but i would guess NO. I was shocked looking at the two little green gel tabs, I put them in my mouth without hesitation and felt them disolve. OH WOW i thought before any of the effects kicked in, I just ate something that's going to make me trip for hours and hours seeing everything I've ever wanted to!\n\nHere I will give my previous drug experience:\nI had smoked endless amounts of pot just about every day starting about mid-junior year. I had eaten ecstacy about 5 times and I always felt uncomfortable getting an unnatural ecstatic emotion, and ecstacy is just bad for you, I say, and so does the evidence showing severe brain damage. Also at that point I had had one fun yet mild mushroom experience.\n\nI sat down at the computer to play an online game. I played about 15 minutes until the anticipation really kicked in. I started getting shaky and VERY ANXIOUS. I turned around and saw fishing poles in the corner of the room, they were taller than ever before and they towered over everything! At this point I figured I should go check things out, it's coming on. I got down on the floor and looked at my imitation oriental rug to see what was seen in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the pattern rose off the carpet, my eyes were really starting to play tricks on me.\n\nI need a shower. I get in the bathroom and the towels are breathing and pulsating, my vision was wacky. I could see small areas blown up very big and nothing other than my immediate vision. At this point I'm lost in my visuals and I'm in the shower feeling fucking great. I see a drop of water on the shower curtain and think, 'what would life be like inside a drop of water?'\n\nI'm out of the shower and decide to play my bass guitar. I put on Rage against the Machine's - Battle of LA. I am really feeling the music AND the the LSD...what a suprise! I'm softly inserting undertones on my bass, and I see the neck and strings all waving, up close, big, out of proportion, completely and utterly awesome! The anxiety is still there, STRONG, I'm trying to enjoy myself but the LSD is so freakin powerful!!!\n\nI start hearing audio hallucinations and at the same time visuals of lights turning on and off, plenty of color. The audio hallucinations sounded like the devil. Voices outside sounded like rumbling thunder. At this point I really need to talk to someone. I call my Mom at work. As soon as I start speaking I sound very loud and unusual, my Mom asks if I'm alright...what am I supposed to say, 'Well I'm on LSD!' No, that's not right.\n\nNow I REALLY need to leave my house or else the anxiety will drive me into a wall! I go outside with the phone and a cigarette. The side of my house looked like it was expanding in the upwards and downwards directions. I get in touch with my friend, who I'll call N, and I go to his house down the street to meet him and another friend A, whom were and are two of my best friends.\n\nWhen I get there I'm talking very loud and I say I think I've eaten some LSD. After a while, it is abundantly clear to them that I have. They stick by me and keep me relaxed. We drive over to a friend's house I'll call E, another best, and he has a friend chillin there. I wasn't feeling too high at this point, but everything on my mind was affecting me.\n\nI call my Mom again to talk, I tell her what happened, and she wants me home immediately. This was something I had to struggle with, I didn't wanna go home I'm out enjoying a high what good would coming home be if i'm going to get in trouble??? I decided to stay out and told my parents I would be safe and home later that evening.\n\nI go have a quality conversation with my friend A. He is a very experienced tripper of LSD and he comforts while we talk about jokes or funny experiences while the other people are out somewhere. They get back and I go for a ride with my friend N, we talk and I tell him how horrible the situation I'm in is, and that I'm in trouble. He ensures me that he is there and will help me.\n\nWe get back to E's house and then another friend shows up, he wants to smoke. Five of us head down the street to another friend's house to smoke. We sit out back and smoke dank bud out of a bubbler. My high starts to come back a little but the plateau had worn off a while ago.\n\nMy thinking goes on auto-pilot. I would think about the ramifications and harmony that come about through conversation. I decided not to speak after my thoughts flew right past the conversation.\n\nI come around after taking a piss and declare that on this day I am fucked up! At this point I feel sober enough to talk. I start to relax and my anxiety goes away. The trip slowed down and I started coming back to baseline.\n\nI decide it would be good to go home around 5 PM. When I go home I see some more visuals, talk with my parents, and make ammends. Almost a year has passed now. Since that summer, in the way of drugs I've decided not to touch cocaine, not to take LSD, ecstacy, heroine, ect...be careful, especially of the big ones...i'm serious\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this and learned a few things...\n\n\nRetrospective:\nFrom my personal experience...\n\nEating LSD at 9 AM: expect a freaking trip (see above) ^^.\nGel Tabs are potent, handle with care. I ate some 2 hits of paper/blotter about 2 months later and it wasn't a quarter as strong.\n\nHave friends & people you love to be with. \n\n","\nThis is my recollection of my first acid trip. It was done with my girlfriend who had never done it either. My experience with drugs consists of chemicals such as MDMA, MDA, MDE, Methamphetamine ' by accident, thinking the were Ecstasy pills, Ketamine, Dipenhydramine (Dramamine), Adderall, Vicadin and plants such as marijuana and mushrooms.\n\nSetting: My friend's apartment with no one home except my girlfriend and I, very trippy one floor apartment weird pictures on the walls and interesting color schemes. Outside the weather is awful, raining/snowing/sleeting and cold. The night before, well about 1 that morning we took about 250 mg of Ketamine each at a rave and sniffed Rush, so that might have been a factor in the upcoming trip. At around 12:30 pm we dropped 3 tabs each and waited.\n\nT+1 hour: Starting to feel odd, just straight out weird, a bit anxious, I can feel it in my stomach its really annoying, we're giggling about everything mocking the cats in the house, I don't even know why, it was just funny. We start seeing some visuals, things turning and spiraling and patterns emerging and such, nothing brilliant but hey it was entertaining, the nausea is subsiding a bit. All of a sudden my friend (whose house I was at) comes into the house crying, and I think 'oh shit, tell me this isn't just a perfectly clich' event to lead us onto a bad trip.'\n\nSo I go into the other room and that's when the fear starts coming, because we just started coming up fairly strong when my friend came in and I'm like damnet, so I started thinking of like all these terrible things associated with evil and death and it was just scary, and I was on the VERGE of freaking out when my girlfriend came in and comforted me, saying how she was okay and my friend had made her hot chocolate. So I calmed down a bit, my friend left and it was us 2 again in the house.\n\nT+2 hours: I'm starting to get reallly paranoid of my friends mom coming home, even though I knew for a fact she would not be home till about 6:30 and it was about 2 or 2:30. I kept trying to comprehend what was happening as nothing was real anymore, patterns emerged from every crevice of the room, the music was incredible but I just felt SO weird I couldn't take it. I was in a continual thought loop trying to figure out what was going on. I kept getting real scared and I just wanted it to end. My girlfriend calmed me down a bit, it took a while but she did. Making out is real weird, I got bizarre mental visions. I kept envisioning weird colors in my mind.\n\nT+2.5 hours: Now the ceiling is raining rainbows, though the ceiling is actually white, and occasionally I see bursts of butterflies or it would start raining roses down on us. I was getting antsy again as I didn't know what to do with myself, we were literally stuck in the house because we couldn't go outside. The reason we couldn't go outside is when we looked out the window the trees turned alive and multiplied their branches and were just terrifying.\n\nStaring at the water on the ground from the second story window, the water turned into multitudes of letters and formed words. I was looking at black crows go by and right after they went by, a good 100+ more crows flew by in different areas of the sky (obviously hallucinations). So overall outside was too scary, but we didn't know what to do. I couldn't escape my mind which was on sensory overload. If there was no music I would hear sounds possibly miles away as if they were right next to me, and what was worse was they echoed - LOUD. And then there were more and more and more noises to the point where I couldn't be in the room.\n\nT+3 hours: The acid was getting to me. I kept thinking that this wouldn't end and I'd be in a world that wasn't real forever, nothing was real anymore, the fan was alive, the walls were alive, the blankets were alive, the floor was alive. Patterns melted into each other, and then formed new ones, from those patterns came new ones. The tracers were unbelievable, I'd be able to swing my hands around and I could move the color/pattern scheme of one object right onto another object. If the wall was striped I could bring the stripes onto the floor.\n\nAs I walked into each room I began turning every light on in the apartment to make everything glow its own individual color. And it did, as I walked into the kitchen everything was green, we decided we were hungry but couldn't eat anything so I took out clementimes. The problem was they were green, so we thought they were bad. The problem was that we forgot that when oranges are green it just means there not totally ripe. Somehow we thought that it was like bread, which turns green (mold) when it's bad, so it took us a while to figure that out.\n\nT+4 hours: I am crazy. I am so far gone that I actually gave up. When my girlfriend was wondering the apartment, I decided to sit in this little tiny back room next to the refrigerator and wait it out. My girlfriend, being the persistent little girl she is came in and sat with me and basically talked me through it somehow. The irony is that I'm about 1000x more experienced than her but she managed to talk me into being happy. At one point I saw a train go by the window and my girlfriend saw a little girl standing in the middle of the room pointing towards a chandelier.\n\nAt this point the music started getting overwhelming, my music selection was shitty as I kind of just figured pink Floyd would be amazing, but in fact it was so bizarre it was actually scaring me so we vigorously searched through my friend's selection and found Good Charlotte. Yes - good charlotte, we put it in and it was so corny that it made me happy! So were tripping out on the floor in her living room as my girlfriend is peeling/feeding me oranges and listening to Good Charlotte. By the way, eating fruit you like is a must; it beats any munchies I've ever ingested.\n\nT+5 hours: At this point the mental part of the trip is diminishing, I have almost complete control of my mind which is wonderful because I'm totally not paranoid anymore and overall I'm just happy. But the great thing was, was the visuals were still increasing in intensity. The most beautiful patterns I've ever seen are appearing everywhere, everywhere I looked things were alive, and it was magnificent. On top of that, I was starting to melt from time to time. I would actually feel my fingers extending or growing or getting fat/thin and I'd see it as well. In fact I even showed my girlfriend how my fingers were stretching and she saw it as I saw it and as I felt it.\n\nI was also, as well, able to control the movement of certain things with certain body parts, for example as my hand grew and shrank and moved I could move the door in that same fashion. As with looking at ourselves and each other, when I looked at my girlfriend her head would grow and shrink, and her eyes would grow huge, as well as her feet, but the rest of her body shrunk. It was if we were in Sonic the Hedgehog or Mario - actually she looked like a hedgehog, or tails from Sonic. At one point I saw my girlfriend was doing something weird with her arm, she was like trying to grab something in the sleeve of her sweatshirt with her hand. I asked her what she was doing and she said that her hand was lonely and wanted to meet another body part.\n\nAt one point we were standing in the kitchen and I was saying how I was hungry and could go for a snickers bar. All of a sudden she's like 'Yeah! Jesse.' and that was it. I knew the rest of what she was going to say as one time Jesse gave us a snickers bar when we came home rolling and needed food bad, I knew the rest of what she was going to say because her memory actually transferred to me visually, I saw it happen in front of my eyes at that moment.\n\nT+6 hours: At this point the visuals are receding, but just barely, the thought process was still really weird/fun. We took up some recreational time by drawing; I drew on her as she drew on a piece of paper. It looks like a mushroom but upside down it's supposed to have facial features. This was my girlfriend's doing, creative eh?\n\nT+8 hours: Sexual activity is fun, and were just having fun, things are still visually interesting, many things still breathing and swirling and very fun too look at, many patterns are still manifesting the house. We're laughing about a lot of things again and my girlfriend was sticking her tongue out at some poster cos she thought he was mean. haha.\n\nT+9 hours we were still seeing visuals but my dad came and picked us up and brought my girlfriend home. When I came home I ate food, which was kinda icky, and talked to my girlfriend on the phone till 3 am - visuals were still here, I have some trippy shit in my room, lava lamps, electricity balls, etc. And they were making butterflies all over my ceiling.\n\nThe next morning I felt fairly fine, a bit brain dead. I wasn't too enthused to go to work for 6 hours, but managed to go and didn't do to bad. Currently, the next day at 7:30 pm I feel almost completely back to normal.\n\nOverall this was probably the most intense, but greatest more glorious experience of my entire life. I will definitely do it again, maybe next time in a better setting like outside in a park or in my room at night with my girlfriend of course, after all she did save my sanity.\n\n","Article 2001: The Free Trade Commission\n1.

The Committee shall report and provide recommendations to the Commission on general issues referred to it by the Commission respecting the availability, use and effectiveness of arbitration and other procedures for the resolution of such disputes in the free trade area.\n\n","Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 104th Congress, my fellow Americans: Again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy, and once again our democracy has spoken. So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress and congratulating you, Mr. Speaker.\nIf we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994. And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992.\nI must say that in both years we didn't hear America singing, we heard America shouting. And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must say, \"We hear you. We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us. For we are the keepers of a sacred trust, and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era.\"\nOver 200 years ago, our Founders changed the entire course of human history by joining together to create a new country based on a single powerful idea: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, . . . endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, and among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\nIt has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea, the American idea, and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times: to Lincoln and to his Congress to preserve the Union and to end slavery; to Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to restrain the abuses and excesses of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world; to Franklin Roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the Great Depression and to win our country's great struggle against fascism; and to all our Presidents since to fight the cold war. Especially, I recall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with Congresses where the majority was of a different party: to Harry Truman, who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the architecture of the cold war; and to Ronald Reagan, whom we wish well tonight and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against communism was won.\nIn another time of change and challenge, I had the honor to be the first President to be elected in the post-cold-war era, an era marked by the global economy, the information revolution, unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for the American people. I came to this hallowed Chamber 2 years ago on a mission, to restore the American dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world. I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored. In this effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes, and I have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor. But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was 2 years ago. Thank you.\nRecord numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global economy. We are at peace, and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world. We have almost 6 million new jobs since I became President, and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. Our businesses are more productive. And here we have worked to bring the deficit down, to expand trade, to put more police on our streets, to give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities.\nBut the rising tide is not lifting all boats. While our Nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our people are still working harder and harder, for less and less. While our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and competitive, too many of our people still can't be sure of having a job next year or even next month. And far more than our material riches are threatened, things far more precious to us, our children, our families, our values.\nOur civil life is suffering in America today. Citizens are working together less and shouting at each other more. The common bonds of community which have been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed. What are we to do about it?\nMore than 60 years ago, at the dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt told our Nation, \"New conditions impose new requirements on Government and those who conduct Government.\" And from that simple proposition, he shaped the New Deal, which helped to restore our Nation to prosperity and define the relationship between our people and their Government for half a century.\nThat approach worked in its time. But we today, we face a very different time and very different conditions. We are moving from an industrial age built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility. Our Government, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen by many as simply a captive of narrow interests, putting more burdens on our citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead. The values that used to hold us all together seem to be coming apart.\nSo tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of understandings, not just with Government but, even more important, with one another as Americans.\nThat's what I want to talk with you about tonight. I call it the New Covenant. But it's grounded in a very, very old idea, that all Americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their God-given talents and determination can take them and to give something back to their communities and their country in return. Opportunity and responsibility: They go hand in hand. We can't have one without the other. And our national community can't hold together without both.\nOur New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our people to meet the challenges of a new economy, how we can change the way our Government works to fit a different time, and, above all, how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common purpose. We must have dramatic change in our economy, our Government, and ourselves.\nMy fellow Americans, without regard to party, let us rise to the occasion. Let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride. As we embark on this new course, let us put our country first, remembering that regardless of party label, we are all Americans. And let the final test of everything we do be a simple one: Is it good for the American people?\nLet me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not better servants. You made a good start by passing that law which applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector, and I was proud to sign it yesterday. But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work around here. Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors of Washington as were here 20 years ago. The American people look at their Capital, and they see a city where the well-connected and the well-protected can work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left out.\nAs the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still doing business as usual; the gifts, the trips, all the things that people are concerned about haven't stopped. Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices. I know there were other considerations in those votes, but I want to use something that I've heard my Republican friends say from time to time, \"There doesn't have to be a law for everything.\" So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists' perks. Just stop. We don't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the American people that things are really changing. But I also hope you will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill, and I'll sign that, too.\nWe should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what they're spending, what they want. We should also curb the role of big money in elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of PAC's. And as I have said for 3 years, we should work to open the airwaves so that they can be an instrument of democracy, not a weapon of destruction, by giving free TV time to candidates for public office.\nWhen the last Congress killed political reform last year, it was reported in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the Halls of this sacred building and cheered. This year, let's give the folks at home something to cheer about.\nMore important, I think we all agree that we have to change the way the Government works. Let's make it smaller, less costly, and smarter; leaner, not meaner.\nI just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine is alive and well.\nThe New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter. The old way of governing around here protected organized interests. We should look out for the interests of ordinary people. The old way divided us by interest, constituency, or class. The New Covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of what's best for our country. The old way dispensed services through large, top-down, inflexible bureaucracies. The New Covenant way should shift these resources and decisionmaking from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy. The old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure. The New Covenant way should have built-in incentives to reward success. The old way was centralized here in Washington. The New Covenant way must take hold in the communities all across America. And we should help them to do that.\nOur job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy, to empower people to make the most of their own lives, and to enhance our security here at home and abroad. We must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves. We should rely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for each other.\nI hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters, we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is somehow a program for every problem, on the one hand, and the other illusion that the Government is a source of every problem we have. Our job is to get rid of yesterday's Government so that our own people can meet today's and tomorrow's needs. And we ought to do it together.\nYou know, for years before I became President, I heard others say they would cut Government and how bad it was, but not much happened. We actually did it. We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending, more than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions from the Federal bureaucracy in the last 2 years alone. Based on decisions already made, we will have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million positions from the Federal Government, making it the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was President, by the time I come here again next year.\nUnder the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have already saved taxpayers $63 billion. The age of the $500 hammer and the ashtray you can break on \"David Letterman\" is gone. Deadwood programs, like mohair subsidies, are gone. We've streamlined the Agriculture Department by reducing it by more than 1,200 offices. We've slashed the small business loan form from an inch thick to a single page. We've thrown away the Government's 10,000-page personnel manual.\nAnd the Government is working better in important ways: FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has gone from being a disaster to helping people in disasters. You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or the people in California who have dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires, and they'll tell you that. Government workers, working hand in hand with private business, rebuilt southern California's fractured freeways in record time and under budget. And because the Federal Government moved fast, all but one of the 5,600 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business.\nNow, there are a lot of other things that I could talk about. I want to just mention one because it will be discussed here in the next few weeks. University administrators all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable with better repayment terms for students, costs the Government less, and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the Government and for the universities. We shouldn't cap that program. We should give every college in America the opportunity to be a part of it.\nPrevious Government programs gathered dust. The reinventing Government report is getting results. And we're not through. There's going to be a second round of reinventing Government. We propose to cut $130 billion in spending by shrinking departments, extending our freeze on domestic spending, cutting 60 public housing programs down to 3, getting rid of over 100 programs we do not need, like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program. And we're working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more sensible. The programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should go. We have to cut yesterday's Government to help solve tomorrow's problems.\nAnd we need to get Government closer to the people it's meant to serve. We need to help move programs down to the point where States and communities and private citizens in the private sector can do a better job. If they can do it, we ought to let them do it. We should get out of the way and let them do what they can do better. Taking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for.\nIt's time for Congress to stop passing on to the States the cost of decisions we make here in Washington. I know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded mandates legislation, but I want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interests and give justified relief where we need to give it.\nFor years, Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending projects. Last year was no difference. There was a $1 million to study stress in plants and $12 million for a tick removal program that didn't work. It's hard to remove ticks. Those of us who have had them know. But I'll tell you something, if you'll give me line-item veto, I'll remove some of that unnecessary spending.\nBut I think we should all remember, and almost all of us would agree, that Government still has important responsibilities. Our young people—we should think of this when we cut—our young people hold our future in their hands. We still owe a debt to our veterans. And our senior citizens have made us what we are. Now, my budget cuts a lot. But it protects education, veterans, Social Security, and Medicare, and I hope you will do the same thing. You should, and I hope you will.\nAnd when we give more flexibility to the States, let us remember that there are certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every State, North and South, East and West: Immunization against childhood disease, school lunches in all our schools, Head Start, medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants, all these things, all these things are in the national interest.\nI applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations. But when we deregulate, let's remember what national action in the national interest has given us: safer food for our families, safer toys for our children, safer nursing homes for our parents, safer cars and highways, and safer workplaces, cleaner air, and cleaner water. Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations? You bet we do. But we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water. We can have fairness and still clean up toxic dumps, and we ought to do it.\nShould we cut the deficit more? Well, of course we should. Of course we should. But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic recovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished but instead should be helped.\nI know many of you in this Chamber support the balanced budget amendment. I certainly want to balance the budget. Our administration has done more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very, very long time. If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do, then you have to be straight with the American people. They have a right to know what you're going to cut, what taxes you're going to raise, and how it's going to affect them. We should be doing things in the open around here. For example, everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social Security. I would oppose that, and I think most Americans would.\nNothing has done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our failed welfare system. This is one of the problems we have to face here in Washington in our New Covenant. It rewards welfare over work. It undermines family values. It lets millions of parents get away without paying their child support. It keeps a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time.\nI've worked on this problem for a long time, nearly 15 years now. As a Governor, I had the honor of working with the Reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988. In the last 2 years, we made a good start at continuing the work of welfare reform. Our administration gave two dozen States the right to slash through Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency.\nLast year I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by an administration. We have to make welfare what it was meant to be, a second chance, not a way of life. We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible, to provide child care and teach them skills, if that's what they need, for up to 2 years. And after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule: Anyone who can work must go to work. If a parent isn't paying child support, they should be forced to pay. We should suspend drivers' license, track them across State lines, make them work off what they owe. That is what we should do. Governments do not raise children, people do. And the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world.\nI want to work with you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform. But our goal must be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to independence, from welfare to work, from mere childbearing to responsible parenting. Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor.\nWe should, we should require work and mutual responsibility. But we shouldn't cut people off just because they're poor, they're young, or even because they're unmarried. We should promote responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised settings, by requiring them to finish school. But we shouldn't put them and their children out on the street. And I know all the arguments, pro and con, and I have read and thought about this for a long time. I still don't think we can in good conscience punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.\nMy fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the American people care about this without regard to party or race or region. So let this be the year we end welfare as we know it. But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue to divide America. No one is more eager to end welfareI may be the only President who has actually had the opportunity to sit in a welfare office, who's actually spent hours and hours talking to people on welfare. And I am telling you, the people who are trapped on it know it doesn't work; they also want to get off. So we can promote, together, education and work and good parenting. I have no problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent. I just don't want to punish poverty and past mistakes. All of us have made our mistakes, and none of us can change our yesterdays. But every one of us can change our tomorrows. And America's best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey, who worked her way off welfare to become a Congresswoman from the State of California.\nI know the Members of this Congress are concerned about crime, as are all the citizens of our country. And I remind you that last year we passed a very tough crime bill: longer sentences, \"three strikes and you're out,\" almost 60 new capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention, 100,000 more police. And we paid for it all by reducing the size of the Federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower the crime rate.\nThere may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be smarter with crime, to help to lower that rate first. Well, if there are, let's talk about them, and let's do them. But let's not go back on the things that we did last year that we know work, that we know work because the local law enforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing, because local community leaders who have worked for years and years to lower the crime rate tell us that they work. Let's look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it. And if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate—and I am convinced that it does—let us not go back on it. Let's stick with it, implement it. We've got 4 more hard years of work to do to do that.\nI don't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight, but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly last year. The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and, in the crime bill, the ban on 19 assault weapons. I don't think it's a secret to anybody in this room that several Members of the last Congress who voted for that aren't here tonight because they voted for it. And I know, therefore, that some of you who are here because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it. I just have to tell you how I feel about it.\nThe Members of Congress who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activities. I've done it since I was a boy, and I'm going to keep right on doing it until I can't do it anymore. But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of assault weapon attack, and I will not let that be repealed. I will not let it be repealed.\nI'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with. I want us to cut more spending, but I hope we won't cut Government programs that help to prepare us for the new economy, promote responsibility, and are organized from the grassroots up, not by Federal bureaucracy. The very best example of this is the national service corps, AmeriCorps. It passed with strong bipartisan support. And now there are 20,000 Americans, more than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps, working all over this country, helping people person-to-person in local grassroots volunteer groups, solving problems, and in the process earning some money for their education. This is citizenship at its best. It's good for the AmeriCorps members, but it's good for the rest of us, too. It's the essence of the New Covenant, and we shouldn't stop it.\nAll Americans, not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens. In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.\nThe most important job of our Government in this new era is to empower the American people to succeed in the global economy. America has always been a land of opportunity, a land where, if you work hard, you can get ahead. We've become a great middle class country. Middle class values sustain us. We must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass, even as we do everything we can to support the millions of Americans who are already successful in the new economy.\nAmerica is once again the world's strongest economic power: almost 6 million new jobs in the last 2 years, exports booming, inflation down. High-wage jobs are coming back. A record number of American entrepreneurs are living the American dream. If we want it to stay that way, those who work and lift our Nation must have more of its benefits.\nToday, too many of those people are being left out. They're working harder for less. They have less security, less income, less certainty that they can even afford a vacation, much less college for their kids or retirement for themselves. We cannot let this continue. If we don't act, our economy will probably keep doing what it's been doing since about 1978, when the income growth began to go to those at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle got very little growth, and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then fell even further and further behind in the years afterward, no matter how hard they worked.\nWe've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this new economy work for all of our people, a Government that helps each and every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skills. That's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the last 2 years, from Head Start to public schools, to apprenticeships for young people who don't go to college, to making college loans more available and more affordable. That's the first thing we have to do. We've got to do something to empower people to improve their skills.\nThe second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes immediately by lowering their taxes. We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million families with incomes under $27,000, a tax cut that this year will average about $1,000 a family. And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses. Before we could do more than that, we first had to bring down the deficit we inherited, and we had to get economic growth up. Now we've done both. And now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way. But tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation: to empower our citizens through education and training to make the most of their own lives. The spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for themselves, their families, and their communities.\nI have proposed the middle class bill of rights, which should properly be called the bill of rights and responsibilities because its provisions only benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to educate themselves. It will, therefore, give needed tax relief and raise incomes in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefits all of us.\nThere are four provisions. First, a tax deduction for all education and training after high school. If you think about it, we permit businesses to deduct their investment, we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages, but today an education is even more important to the economic well-being of our whole country than even those things are. We should do everything we can to encourage it. And I hope you will support it. Second, we ought to cut taxes $500 for families with children under 13. Third, we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by permitting people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education, health care, first-time homebuying, or the care of a parent. And fourth, we should pass a GI bill for America's workers. We propose to collapse nearly 70 Federal programs and not give the money to the States but give the money directly to the American people, offer vouchers to them so that they, if they're laid off or if they're working for a very low wage, can get a voucher worth $2,600 a year for up to 2 years to go to their local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills they need to improve their lives. Let's empower people in this way, move it from the Government directly to the workers of America.\nNow, any one of us can call for a tax cut, but I won't accept one that explodes the deficit or puts our recovery at risk. We ought to pay for our tax cuts fully and honestly.\nJust 2 years ago, it was an open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit. Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then, many of whom didn't return, we did cut the deficit. We began to do what others said would not be done. We cut the deficit by over $600 billion, about $10,000 for every family in this country. It's coming down 3 years in a row for the first time since Mr. Truman was President, and I don't think anybody in America wants us to let it explode again.\nIn the budget I will send you, the middle class bill of rights is fully paid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy, cuts in programs, cuts in special interest subsidies. And the spending cuts will more than double the tax cuts. My budget pays for the middle class bill of rights without any cuts in Medicare. And I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with Medicare cuts. That's not the right thing to do.\nI know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief, and some of them I find quite interesting. I really want to work with all of you. My test for our proposals will be: Will it create jobs and raise incomes; will it strengthen our families and support our children; is it paid for; will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass? If it does, I'll support it. But if it doesn't, I won't.\nThe goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is also why I believe that you should raise the minimum wage. It rewards work. Two and a half million Americans, two and a half million Americans, often women with children, are working out there today for $4.25 an hour. In terms of real buying power, by next year that minimum wage will be at a 40-year low. That's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work.\nNow, I've studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum wage increase. I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market. But the most important thing is, you can't make a living on $4.25 an hour, especially if you have children, even with the working families tax cut we passed last year. In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue, and I think it should be again. So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on this, to get together, to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage.\nMembers of Congress have been here less than a month, but by the end of the week, 28 days into the new year, every Member of Congress will have earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker makes all year long.\nEverybody else here, including the President, has something else that too many Americans do without, and that's health care. Now, last year we almost came to blows over health care, but we didn't do anything. And the cold, hard fact is that, since last year, since I was here, another 1.1 million Americans in working families have lost their health care. And the cold, hard fact is that many millions more, most of them farmers and small business people and self-employed people, have seen their premiums skyrocket, their copays and deductibles go up. There's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have health insurance but really what they've got is a piece of paper that says they won't lose their home if they get sick.\nNow, I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health security for every American family. But I know that last year, as the evidence indicates, we bit off more than we could chew. So I'm asking you that we work together. Let's do it step by step. Let's do whatever we have to do to get something done. Let's at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage for facing skyrocketing prices, that nobody loses their coverage because they face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or lose a job or a family member gets sick.\nI want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this, with the Democrats who worked on it last time, with the Republican leaders like Senator Dole, who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made some constructive proposals in this area last year. We ought to make sure that self-employed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools. We ought to help families provide long-term care for a sick parent or a disabled child. We can work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work. And we can find a way—it may take some time, but we can find a way—to make sure that our children have health care.\nYou know, I think everybody in this room, without regard to party, can be proud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world's most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade. But we can't be proud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the world that has a smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health insurance today than we did 10 years ago, the last time we were the most productive economy in the world. So let's work together on this. It is too important for politics as usual.\nMuch of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we've already talked about. A lot of people think that the security concerns of America today are entirely internal to our borders. They relate to the security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children, our streets, our health, and protecting those borders. Now that the cold war has passed, it's tempting to believe that all the security issues, with the possible exception of trade, reside here at home. But it's not so. Our security still depends upon our continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy. We still can't be strong at home unless we're strong abroad.\nThe financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point. I know it's not popular to say it tonight, but we have to act, not for the Mexican people but for the sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to Mexico's well-being. If we want to secure American jobs, preserve American exports, safeguard America's borders, then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put Mexico back on track.\nNow let me repeat: It's not a loan; it's not foreign aid; it's not a bailout. We will be given a guarantee like cosigning a note, with good collateral that will cover our risks. This legislation is the right thing for America. That's why the bipartisan leadership has supported it. And I hope you in Congress will pass it quickly. It is in our interest, and we can explain it to the American people because we're going to do it in the right way.\nYou know, tonight, this is the first State of the Union Address ever delivered since the beginning of the cold war when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America. And along with the Russians, we're on our way to destroying the missiles and the bombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads. We've come so far so fast in this post-cold-war world that it's easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for granted. But it's still there, and we aren't finished yet.\nThis year I'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons that carry 5,000 more warheads. The United States will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical weapons. To stop and roll back North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear program, we'll continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation. It's smart. It's tough. It's a deal based on continuing inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves.\nThis year I'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home or abroad. As the cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out, this country will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice.\nJust this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and injured scores more. On behalf of the American people and all of you, I send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in the face of such evil, it is hard for the people in the Middle East to go forward. But the terrorists represent the past, not the future. We must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors in the Middle East.\nAccordingly, last night I signed an Executive order that will block the assets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the peace process. It prohibits financial transactions with these groups. And tonight I call on all our allies and peace-loving nations throughout the world to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism. We cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and paralysis.\nFrom the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our Nation would maintain the best equipped, best trained, and best prepared military on Earth. We have, and they are. They have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit. But to make sure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their families deserve, I'm asking the Congress to add $25 billion in defense spending over the next 6 years.\nI have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became President. Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction. We ask a very great deal of our Armed Forces. Now that they are smaller in number, we ask more of them. They go out more often to more different places and stay longer. They are called to service in many, many ways. And we must give them and their families what the times demand and what they have earned.\nJust think about what our troops have done in the last year, showing America at its best, helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda, moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait, giving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti. We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South Africa to Northern Ireland, from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia, from Latin America to the Middle East. All these endeavors are good in those places, but they make our future more confident and more secure.\nWell, my fellow Americans, that's my agenda for America's future: expanding opportunity, not bureaucracy; enhancing security at home and abroad; empowering our people to make the most of their own lives. It's ambitious and achievable, but it's not enough. We even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping Americans to compete in the new economy, more than a Government that's smaller, smarter, and wiser, more than all of the changes we can make in Government and in the private sector from the outside in.\nOur fortunes and our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer some questions from within, from the values and voices that speak to our hearts as well as our heads; voices that tell us we have to do more to accept responsibility for ourselves and our families, for our communities, and yes, for our fellow citizens. We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart, and we feel the common ground shifting from under us. The PTA, the town hall meeting, the ball park, it's hard for a lot of overworked parents to find the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation. Too many of our children don't even have parents and grandparents who can give them those experiences that they need to build their own character and their sense of identity.\nWe all know what while we here in this Chamber can make a difference on those things, that the real differences will be made by our fellow citizens, where they work and where they live and that it will be made almost without regard to party. When I used to go to the softball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter's league, and people would come up to me, fathers and mothers, and talk to me, I can honestly say I had no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or Democrats. When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California, northern California, last week, a woman came up to me and did something that very few of you would do. She hugged me and said, \"Mr. President, I'm a Republican, but I'm glad you're here.\"\nNow, why? We can't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every day, because as we move into this next century, everybody matters. We don't have a person to waste. And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to do better. That means that we need a New Covenant for everybody.\nFor our corporate and business leaders, we're going to work here to keep bringing the deficit down, to expand markets, to support their success in every possible way. But they have an obligation when they're doing well to keep jobs in our communities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate.\nFor people in the entertainment industry in this country, we applaud your creativity and your worldwide success, and we support your freedom of expression. But you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant, repetitive, mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media all the time.\nWe've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to help us stop our most serious social problem, the epidemic of teen pregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I have sent to Congress a plan to target schools all over this country with antipregnancy programs that work. But Government can only do so much. Tonight I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference. We can do this, and we must.\nAnd I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders. You know, I'm proud of the fact the United States has more houses of worship per capita than any country in the world. These people who lead our houses of worship can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action, can reach out to all of our children, to all of the people in distress, to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear. Because so much of what must be done must come from the inside out and our religious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference, they have a role in the New Covenant as well.\nThere must be more responsibility for all of our citizens. You know, it takes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets and in school. It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity houses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin. It takes a lot of people to provide the people power for all of the civic organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were kids. It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be.\nI know it's hard when you're working harder for less, when you're under great stress to do these things. A lot of our people don't have the time or the emotional stress, they think, to do the work of citizenship.\nMost of us in politics haven't helped very much. For years, we've mostly treated citizens like they were consumers or spectators, sort of political couch potatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads either promise them something for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations. And more and more of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive ways that are hardly conducive to honest and open conversations. But the truth is, we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different views.\nIf you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of America, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago, has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And in this day, everybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply cannot want for a tornado, a fire, or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another.\nI want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the First Lady that represent what I'm trying to talk about—citizens. I have no idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last election. But they represent what we ought to be doing.\nCindy Perry teaches second graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural Kentucky. She gains when she gives. She's a mother of four. She says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency last year. She was married when she was a teenager—stand up, Cindy. She was married when she was a teenager. She had four children. But she had time to serve other people, to get her high school equivalency, and she's going to use her AmeriCorps money to go back to college.\nChief Stephen Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City. He's been a national leader—stand up, Steve. He's been a national leader in using more police in community policing, and he's worked with AmeriCorps to do it. And the crime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he did.\nCorporal Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country's force to help secure democracy in his native land. And I might add, we must be the only country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken Haitian-Americans there who could speak the language and talk to the people. And he was one of them, and we're proud of him.\nThe next two folks I've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a little bit, the Reverend John and the Reverend Diana Cherry of the AME Zion Church in Temple Hills, Maryland. I'd like to ask them to stand. I want to tell you about them. In the early eighties, they left Government service and formed a church in a small living room in a small house, in the early eighties. Today that church has 17,000 members. It is one of the three or four biggest churches in the entire United States. It grows by 200 a month. They do it together. And the special focus of their ministry is keeping families together.\nTwo things they did make a big impression on me. I visited their church once, and I learned they were building a new sanctuary closer to the Washington, DC, line in a higher crime, higher drug rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them. The second thing I want to say is that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House with some other religious leaders, and he left early to go back to this church to minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all over America to convince them to come back together, to save their marriages, and to raise their kids. This is the kind of work that citizens are doing in America. We need more of it, and it ought to be lifted up and supported.\nThe last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Jack, would you stand up? Fifty years ago, in the sands of Iwo Jima, Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship. On February 20th, 1945, he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them. In that moment, he saved the lives of his companions, and miraculously in the next instant, a medic saved his life. He gained a foothold for freedom, and at the age of 17, just a year older than his grandson who is up there with him today—and his son, who is a West Point graduate and a veteran—at 17, Jack Lucas became the youngest Marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor. All these years later, yesterday, here's what he said about that day: \"It didn't matter where you were from or who you were, you relied on one another. You did it for your country.\"\nWe all gain when we give, and we reap what we sow. That's at the heart of this New Covenant. Responsibility, opportunity, and citizenship, more than stale chapters in some remote civic book, they're still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the enduring dream from that first and most sacred covenant. I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our Creator the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This is a very, very great country. And our best days are still to come.\nThank you, and God bless you all.\n","Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress: It is a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approach for governing our great country.\nI thank you for your invitation to speak here tonight. I know Congress had to formally invite me and it could have been a close vote. So, Mr. Vice President, I appreciate you being here to break the tie. I want to thank so many of you who have accepted my invitation to come to the White House to discuss important issues. We are off to a good start. I will continue to meet with you and ask for your input. You have been kind and candid, and I thank you for making a new President feel welcome.\nThe last time I visited the Capitol, I came to take an oath. On the steps of this building, I pledged to honor our Constitution and laws, and I asked you to join me in setting a tone of civility and respect in Washington. I hope America is noticing the difference. We are making progress. Together, we are changing the tone in the Nation’s capital. And this spirit of respect and cooperation is vital, because in the end we will be judged not only by what we say or how we say it, we will be judged by what we are able to accomplish.\nAmerica today is a Nation with great challenges, but greater resources. An artist using statistics as a brush could paint two very different pictures of our country. One would have warning signs: increasing layoffs, rising energy prices, too many failing schools, persistent poverty, the stubborn vestiges of racism. Another picture would be full of blessings: a balanced budget, big surpluses, a military that is second to none, a country at peace with its neighbors, technology that is revolutionizing the world, and our greatest strength, concerned citizens who care for our country and care for each other.\nNeither picture is complete in and of itself. And tonight I challenge and invite Congress to work with me to use the resources of one picture to repaint the other, to direct the advantages of our time to solve the problems of our people.\nSome of these resources will come from government, some but not all. Year after year in Washington, budget debates seem to come down to an old, tired argument: on one side those who want more government, regardless of the cost; on the other, those who want less government, regardless of the need.\nWe should leave those arguments to the last century and chart a different course. Government has a role, and an important role. Yet too much government crowds out initiative and hard work, private charity and the private economy. Our new governing vision says government should be active but limited, engaged but not overbearing.\nMy budget is based on that philosophy. It is reasonable and it is responsible. It meets our obligations and funds our growing needs. We increase spending next year for Social Security and Medicare and other entitlement programs by $81 billion. We have increased spending for discretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate of inflation. My plan pays down an unprecedented amount of our national debt, and then when money is still left over, my plan returns it to the people who earned it in the first place.\nA budget’s impact is counted in dollars, but measured in lives. Excellent schools, quality health care, a secure retirement, a cleaner environment, a stronger defense, these are all important needs, and we fund them.\nThe highest percentage increase in our budget should go to our children’s education. Education is my top priority. Education is my top priority, and by supporting this budget, you will make it yours as well.\nReading is the foundation of all learning, so during the next 5 years we triple spending, adding $5 billion to help every child in America learn to read. Values are important, so we have tripled funding for character education to teach our children not only reading and writing, but right from wrong.\nWe have increased funding to train and recruit teachers, because we know a good education starts with a good teacher.\nAnd I have a wonderful partner in this effort. I like teachers so much, I married one. Laura has begun a new effort to recruit Americans to the profession that will shape our future: teaching. She will travel across America to promote sound teaching practices and early reading skills in our schools and in programs such as Head Start.\nWhen it comes to our schools, dollars alone do not always make the difference. Funding is important, and so is reform. So we must tie funding to higher standards and accountability for results.\nI believe in local control of schools. We should not and we will not run public schools from Washington, DC. Yet when the Federal government spends tax dollars, we must insist on results. Children should be tested on basic reading and math skills every year, between grades three and eight. Measuring is the only way to know whether all our children are learning, and I want to know, because I refuse to leave any child behind in America.\nCritics of testing contend it distracts from learning. They talk about ‘‘teaching to the test.’’ But let us put that logic to the test. If you test a child on basic math and reading skills and you are ‘‘teaching to the test,’’ you are teaching math and reading, and that is the whole idea.\nAs standards rise, local schools will need more flexibility to meet them, so we must streamline the dozens of Federal education programs into five, and let States spend money in those categories as they see fit. Schools will be given a reasonable chance to improve, and the support to do so.\nYet if they don’t, if they continue to fail, we must give parents and students different options: a better public school, a private school, tutoring, or a charter school. In the end, every child in a bad situation must be given a better choice, because when it comes to our children, failure is simply not an option.\nAnother priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of Medicare and Social Security, and together we will do so. To meet the health care needs of all America’s seniors, we double the Medicare budget over the next 10 years.\nMy budget dedicates $238 billion to Medicare next year alone, enough to fund all current programs and to begin a new prescription drug benefit for lowincome seniors. No senior in America should have to choose between buying food and buying prescriptions.\nTo make sure the retirement savings of America’s seniors are not diverted into any other program, my budget protects all $2.6 trillion of the Social Security surplus for Social Security and for Social Security alone.\nMy budget puts a priority on access to health care, without telling Americans what doctor they have to see or what coverage they must choose. Many working Americans do not have health care coverage, so we will help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax credits. And to provide quality care in low-income neighborhoods, over the next 5 years we will double the number of people served at community health care centers.\nAnd we will address the concerns of those who have health coverage yet worry their insurance company does not care and won’t pay. Together, this Congress and this President will find common ground to make sure doctors make medical decisions and patients get the health care they deserve with a Patients’ Bill of Rights.\nWhen it comes to their health, people want to get the medical care they need, not be forced to go to court because they didn’t get it. We will ensure access to the courts for those with legitimate claims, but first, let us put in place a strong independent review so we promote quality health care, not frivolous lawsuits.\nMy budget also increases funding for medical research, which gives hope to many who struggle with serious disease. Our prayers tonight are with one of your own who is engaged in his own fight against cancer, a fine Representative and a good man, Congressman JOE MOAKLEY. I can think of no more appropriate tribute to JOE than to have the Congress finish the job of doubling the budget for the National Institutes of Health.\nMy New Freedom Initiative for Americans with Disabilities funds new technologies, expands opportunities to work, and makes our society more welcoming. For the more than 50 million Americans with disabilities, we must continue to break down barriers to equality.\nThe budget I propose to you also supports the people who keep our country strong and free, the men and women who serve in the United States military. I am requesting $5.7 billion in increased military pay and benefits, and health care and housing. Our men and women in uniform give America their best, and we owe them our support.\nAmerica’s veterans honored their commitment to our country through their military service. I will honor our commitment to them with a $1 billion increase to ensure better access to quality care and faster decisions on benefit claims.\nMy budget will improve our environment by accelerating the cleanup of toxic brownfields. I propose we make a major investment in conservation by fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\nOur national parks have a special place in our country’s life. Our parks are places of great natural beauty and history. As good stewards, we must leave them better than we have found them, so I propose providing $4.9 billion over 5 years for the upkeep of these national treasures.\nMy budget adopts a hopeful new approach to help the poor and the disadvantaged. We must encourage and support the work of charities and faithbased and community groups that offer help and love, one person at a time. These groups are working in every neighborhood in America to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence, to provide a hot meal or a mentor, or a safe haven for our children. Government should welcome these groups to apply for funds, not discriminate against them.\nGovernment cannot be replaced by charities or volunteers. Government should not fund religious activities, but our Nation should support the good works of these good people who are helping their neighbors in need. So I propose allowing all taxpayers, whether they itemize or not, to deduct their charitable contributions. Estimates show this could encourage as much as $14 billion a year in new charitable giving, money that will save and change lives.\nOur budget provides more than $700 million over the next 10 years for a Federal Compassion Capital Fund with a focused and noble mission: to provide a mentor for the more than 1 million children with a parent in prison and to support other local efforts to fight illiteracy, teen pregnancy, drug addiction and other difficult problems.\nWith us tonight is the Mayor of Philadelphia. Please help me welcome Mayor John Street. Hi, Mr. Mayor.\nMayor Street has encouraged faithbased and community organizations to make a significant difference in Philadelphia. He has invited me to his city this summer to see compassion in action. I am personally aware of just how effective the mayor is.\nMayor Street is a Democrat. Let the record show I lost his city, big time. But some things are bigger than politics. So I look forward to coming to your city to see your faith-based programs in action.\nAs government promotes compassion, it also must promote justice. Too many of our citizens have cause to doubt our Nation’s justice when the law points a finger of suspicion at groups, instead of individuals. All our citizens are created equal and must be treated equally. Earlier today, I asked John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to develop specific recommendations to end racial profiling.\nIt is wrong, and we will end it in America. It is wrong. In so doing, we will not hinder the work of our Nation’s brave police officers. They protect us every day, often at great risk. But by stopping the abuses of a few, we will add to the public confidence our police officers earn and deserve.\nMy budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing operations. It has funded our Nation’s important priorities. It has protected Social Security and Medicare. And our surpluses are big enough that there is still money left over.\nMany of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt. I listened, and I agree.\nWe owe it to our children and our grandchildren to act now, and I hope you will join me to pay down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years.\nAt the end of those 10 years, we will have paid down all the debt that is available to retire. That is more debt repaid more quickly than has ever been repaid by any nation at any time in history.\nWe should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainties of the future. We should approach our Nation’s budget as any prudent family would, with a contingency fund for emergencies or additional spending needs.\nFor example, after a strategic review, we may need to increase defense spending. We may need to increase spending for our farmers or additional money to reform Medicare. So my budget sets aside almost a trillion dollars over 10 years for additional needs, that is one trillion additional reasons you can feel comfortable supporting this budget.\nWe have increased our budget at a responsible 4 percent. We have funded our priorities. We have paid down all the available debt. We have prepared for contingencies, and we still have money left over. Yogi Berra once said ‘‘when you come to a fork in the road, take it.’’ Now we come to a fork in the road. We have two choices. Even though we have already met our needs, we could spend the money on more and bigger government. That is the road our Nation has traveled in recent years.\nLast year, government spending shot up 8 percent. That is far more than our economy grew, far more than personal income grew and far more than the rate of inflation. If you continue on that road, you will spend the surplus and have to dip into Social Security to pay other bills.\nUnrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to deficits, so we must take a different path. The other choice is to let the American people spend their own money to meet their own needs. I hope you will join me in standing firmly on the side of the people.\nYou see, the growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs. The people of America have been overcharged, and on their behalf, I am here asking for a refund.\nSome say my tax plan is too big. Others say it is too small. I respectfully disagree. This plan is just right.\nI did not throw darts at a board to come up with a number for tax relief. I did not take a poll or develop an arbitrary formula that might sound good. I looked at problems in the Tax Code and calculated the costs to fix them.\nA tax rate of 15 percent is too high for those who earn low wages, so we must lower the rate to 10 percent. No one should pay more than a third of the money they earn in Federal income taxes, so we lowered the top rate to 33 percent.\nThis reform will be welcome relief for America’s small businesses, which often pay taxes at the highest rate, and help for small business means jobs for Americans.\nWe simplified the Tax Code by reducing the number of tax rates from the current five rates to four lower ones, 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. In my plan, no one is targeted in or targeted out. Everyone who pays income taxes will get relief.\nOur government should not tax and thereby discourage marriage, so we reduced the marriage penalty. I want to help families rear and support their children, so we doubled the child credit to $1,000 per child.\nIt is not fair to tax the same earnings twice, once when you earn them and again when you die, so we must repeal the death tax.\nThese changes add up to significant help. A typical family with two children will save $1,600 a year on their Federal income taxes. Now, 1,600 may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a lot to many families.\nSixteen hundred dollars buys gas for two cars for an entire year. It pays tuition for a year at a community college. It pays the average family grocery bill for 3 months. That is real money.\nWith us tonight, representing many American families, are Steven and Josefina Ramos. They are from Pennsylvania, but they could be from any one of your districts. Steven is a network administrator for a school district. Josefina is a Spanish teacher at a charter school, and they have a 2-yearold daughter. Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost $8,000 a year in Federal income taxes. My plan will save them more than $2,000.\nLet me tell you what Steven says, ‘‘$2,000 a year means a lot to my family. If we had this money, it would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in 2 years time.’’ After that, Steven and Josefina want to start saving for Lianna’s college education.\nMy attitude is government should never stand in the way of families achieving their dreams. And as we debate this issue, always remember, the surplus is not the government’s money, the surplus is the people’s money.\nFor lower-income families, my tax plan restores basic fairness. Right now, complicated tax rules punish hard work. A waitress supporting two children on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional dollar she earns above the 25,000. For overtime, her hardest hours, are taxed at nearly 50 percent. This sends a terrible message: You will never get ahead. But America’s message must be different. We must honor hard work, never punish it.\nWith tax relief, overtime will no longer be overtax time for the waitress. People with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage reductions. And millions of additional American families will be removed from the income tax rolls entirely.\nTax relief is right and tax relief is urgent. The long economic expansion that began almost 10 years ago is faltering. Lower interest rates will eventually help, but we cannot assume they will do the job all by themselves.\nForty years ago and then 20 years ago, two Presidents, one Democrat and one Republican, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, advocated tax cuts to, in President Kennedy’s words, ‘‘get this country moving again.’’ They knew then, what we must do now, to create economic growth and opportunity, we must put money back into the hands of the people who buy goods and create jobs.\nWe must act quickly. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has testified before Congress that tax cuts often come too late to stimulate economic recovery. So I want to work with you to give our economy an important jump start by making tax relief retroactive.\nWe must act now because it is the right thing to do. We must also act now because we have other things to do. We must show courage to confront and resolve tough challenges: To restructure our Nation’s defenses, to meet our growing need for energy, and to reform Medicare and Social Security.\nAmerica has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present peace by promoting a distinctly American internationalism. We will work with our allies and friends to be a force for good and a champion of freedom. We will work for free markets and free trade and freedom from oppression. Nations making progress toward freedom will find America is their friend.\nWe will promote our values, and we will promote peace. And we need a strong military to keep the peace. But our military was shaped to confront the challenges of the past. So I have asked the Secretary of Defense to review America’s armed forces and prepare to transform them to meet emerging threats. My budget makes a down payment on the research and development that will be required. Yet, in our broader transformation effort, we must put strategy first, then spending. Our defense vision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around.\nOur Nation also needs a clear strategy to confront the threats of the 21st century, threats that are more widespread and less certain. They range from terrorists who threaten with bombs to tyrants and rogue nations intent on developing weapons of mass destruction. To protect our own people, our allies and friends, we must develop and we must deploy effective missile defenses.\nAnd as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relics, and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today’s needs.\nA strong America is the world’s best hope for peace and freedom. Yet the cause of freedom rests on more than our ability to defend ourselves and our allies. Freedom is exported every day, as we ship goods and products that improve the lives of millions of people. Free trade brings greater political and personal freedom.\nEach of the previous five presidents has had the ability to negotiate farreaching trade agreements. Tonight I ask to give me the strong hand of presidential trade promotion authority, and to do so quickly.\nAs we meet tonight, many citizens are struggling with the high costs of energy. We have a serious energy problem that demands a national energy policy. The West is confronting a major energy shortage that has resulted in high prices and uncertainty. I have asked Federal agencies to work with California officials to help speed construction of new energy sources. And I have directed Vice President Cheney, Commerce Secretary Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham, and other senior members of my administration to develop a national energy policy.\nOur energy demand outstrips our supply. We can produce more energy at home while protecting our environment, and we must. We can produce more electricity to meet demand, and we must. We can promote alternative energy sources and conservation, and we must. America must become more energy independent, and we will.\nPerhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be reforming Medicare and Social Security.\nMedicare’s finances are strained, and its coverage is outdated. Ninety-nine percent of employer-provided health plans offer some form of prescription drug coverage. Medicare does not. The framework for reform has been developed by Senators FRIST and BREAUX and Congressman THOMAS; and now is the time to act. Medicare must be modernized. And we must make sure that every senior on Medicare can choose a health care plan that offers prescription drugs.\nSeven years from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim Social Security benefits. Everyone in this Chamber knows that Social Security is not prepared to fully fund their retirement. And we only have a couple of years to get prepared. Without reform, this country will one day awaken to a stark choice: either a drastic rise in payroll taxes or a radical cut in retirement benefits. There is a better way.\nThis spring I will form a Presidential commission to reform Social Security. The commission will make its recommendations by next fall. Reform should be based on these principles: It must preserve the benefits of all current retirees and those nearing retirement. It must return Social Security to sound financial footing, and it must offer personal savings accounts to younger workers who want them.\nSocial Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on the money they pay into the system. To save the system, we must increase that by allowing younger workers to make safe, sound investments at a higher rate of return.\nOwnership, access to wealth, and independence should not be the privilege of a few. They are the hope of every American, and we must make them the foundation of Social Security.\nBy confronting the tough challenge of reform, by being responsible with our budget, we can earn the trust of the American people. And we can add to that trust by enacting fair and balanced election and campaign reforms.\nThe agenda I have set before you tonight is worthy of a great Nation.\nAmerica is a Nation at peace, but not a Nation at rest. Much has been given to us, and much is expected.\nLet us agree to bridge old divides. But let us also agree that our goodwill must be dedicated to great goals. Bipartisanship is more than minding our manners, it is doing our duty.\nNo one can speak in this Capitol and not be awed by its history. At so many turning points, debates in these chambers have reflected the collected or divided conscience of our country. And when we walk through Statuary Hall and see those men and women of marble, we are reminded of their courage and achievement.\nYet America’s purpose is never found only in statues or history. America’s purpose always stands before us.\nOur generation must show courage in a time of blessing as our Nation has always shown in times of crisis. And our courage, issue by issue, can gather to greatness and serve our country. This is the privilege and responsibility we share. And if we work together, we can prove that public service is noble.\nWe all came here for a reason. We all have things we want to accomplish and promises to keep. Juntos podemos, together we can. We can make Americans proud of their government. Together we can share in the credit of making our country more prosperous and generous and just, and earn from our conscience and from our fellow citizens, the highest possible praise: well done, good and faithful servants.\nThank you all. Good night. And God bless.\n","Asked a girl what she wanted to be\nShe said baby, can't you see\nI want to be famous, a star on the screen\nBut you can do something in between\nBaby you can drive my car\nYes I'm gonna be a star\nBaby you can drive my car\nAnd maybe I'll love you\n\nI told a girl that my prospects were good\nAnd she said baby, it's understood\nWorking for peanuts is all very fine\nBut I can show you a better time\n\nBaby you can drive my car\nYes I'm gonna be a star\nBaby you can drive my car\nAnd maybe I'll love you\n\nI told a girl I can start right away\nAnd she said listen babe I got something to say\nI got no car and it's breaking my heart\nBut I've found a driver and that's a start\n\n","Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"runs\". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.\n\nThe first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely. A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called \"out\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.\n\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan and South Korea.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League. The World Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world.\n\n\n\nA baseball game is played between two teams, each composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an inning. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in college and minor leagues, and six innings at the Little League level). One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond. A player bats at home plate and must proceed counterclockwise to first base, second base, third base, and back home to score a run. The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring and record outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team's batting order comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.\n\nThe game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height. The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.\n\nThere are three basic tools of baseball: the ball, the bat, and the glove or mitt: Protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters.\n * The baseball is about the size of an adult's fist, around 9 inches (23 centimeters) in circumference. It has a rubber or cork center, wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide, with red stitching.\n * The bat is a hitting tool, traditionally made of a single, solid piece of wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around 34 inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42 inches (106 centimeters).\n * The glove or mitt is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers. As an aid in catching and holding onto the ball, it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions.\n\nAt the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the catcher, squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well.\n\nPlay starts with a batter standing at home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts to hit the ball with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out is said to be safe and is on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.\n\nAny runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before or after the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they occupied when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up (contact the base they occupied when the play began, as or after the ball is caught). Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate; a successful effort is a stolen base.\n\nA pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.\n\nWhile the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs. In addition to the strikeout, common ways a member of the batting team may be put out include the flyout, ground out, force out, and tag out. It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play. This is called a double play. Three outs in one play, a triple play, is possible, though rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty.\n\nAn individual player's turn batting or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team's third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.\n\nIf the designated hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH takes the place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of players on a baseball roster, or squad, varies by league and by the level of organized play. A Major League Baseball (MLB) team has a roster of 25 players with specific roles. A typical roster features the following players:\n * Eight position players: the catcher, four infielders, and three outfielders—all of whom play on a regular basis\n * Five starting pitchers who constitute the team's pitching rotation or starting rotation\n * Six relief pitchers, including one closer, who constitute the team's bullpen (named for the off-field area where pitchers warm up)\n * One backup, or substitute, catcher\n * Two backup infielders\n * Two backup outfielders\n * One pinch hitter, or a second backup catcher, or a seventh reliever\n\nMost baseball leagues worldwide have the DH rule, including MLB's American League, Japan's Pacific League, and Caribbean professional leagues, along with major American amateur organizations. The Central League in Japan and the National League do not have the rule, and high-level minor league clubs connected to National League teams are not required to field a DH. In leagues that apply the designated hitter rule, a typical team has nine offensive regulars (including the DH), five starting pitchers, seven or eight relievers, a backup catcher, and two or three other reserve players.\n\nThe manager, or head coach, oversees the team's major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers. Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning. At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, occupying designated coaches' boxes just outside the foul lines, assist in the direction of baserunners when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners during pauses in play. In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform to be allowed on the field to confer with players during a game.\n\nAny baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In MLB, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.\n\nMany of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder.\n\n\n\nThe tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, as well as its general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, which permits any runners on base to advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.\n\nSeveral basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even at the expense of the batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.\n\nThe evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular among children in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by American baseball historian David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and \"tut-ball\". The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. Block discovered that the first recorded game of \"Bass-Ball\" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player. This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants.\n\nBy the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America. The first officially recorded baseball game on this continent was played in Beachville, Ontario, Canada on June 4, 1838. In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of New York City's Knickerbocker Club, led the codification of the so-called Knickerbocker Rules. While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey: the \"New York Nine\" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings. With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area, and by 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the \"national pastime\" or \"national game\". A year later, the sport's first governing body, the National Association of Base Ball Players, was formed. In 1867, it barred participation by African Americans. The more formally structured National League was founded in 1876. Professional Negro leagues formed, but quickly folded. In 1887, softball, under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game. The National League's first successful counterpart, the American League, which evolved from the minor Western League, was established in 1893, and virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by then.\n\nThe National Agreement of 1903 formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall. The Black Sox Scandal of the 1919 World Series led to the formation of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together. The first major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.\n\nCompared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers were more dominant. The so-called dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict new regulations governed the ball's size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the spitball and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. The rise of the legendary player Babe Ruth, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern farm system. A new Negro National League was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the Negro American League. The first elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame took place in 1936. In 1939, Little League Baseball was founded in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nA large number of minor league teams disbanded when World War II led to a player shortage. Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley led the formation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League to help keep the game in the public eye. The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred in 1945: Jackie Robinson was signed by the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers and began playing for their minor league team in Montreal. In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers. Latin American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born Chico Carrasquel and black Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso, became the first Hispanic All-Stars. Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster.\n\nIn 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system. Significant work stoppages occurred in 1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years. Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance. After play resumed in 1995, non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of MLB.\n\nIn 2001, Barry Bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004. In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing Hank Aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs.\n\nWidely known as America's pastime, baseball is well established in several other countries as well. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both Canada and the US. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League.\n\nIn 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at Parque Los Berros in Xalapa, Veracruz. The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada was founded in 1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition. The Dominican Republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912. Professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars, including the Netherlands (formed in 1922), Australia (1934), Japan (1936), Mexico (1937), and Puerto Rico (1938). The Japanese major leagues have long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the United States.\n\nAfter World War II, professional leagues were founded in many Latin American countries, most prominently Venezuela (1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955). Since the early 1970s, the annual Caribbean Series has matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues: the Dominican Professional Baseball League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. In Asia, South Korea (1982), Taiwan (1990) and China (2003) all have professional leagues.\n\nMany European countries have professional leagues as well; the most successful, other than the Dutch league, is the Italian league, founded in 1948. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the Olympic Games. The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries. Other competitions between national teams, such as the Baseball World Cup and the Olympic baseball tournament, were administered by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). Women's baseball is played on an organized amateur basis in numerous countries.\n\nAfter being admitted to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Games. While the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was MLB's reluctance to allow its players to participate during the major league season. MLB initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede its season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.\n\nBaseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none of them is the variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.\n\nIn clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even in the case of multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss.\n\nWhile nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters). In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete. The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently. Other leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.\n\nIn 2016, the average nine-inning playoff game in Major League baseball was 3 hours and 35 minutes. This was up 10 minutes from 2015 and 21 minutes from 2014.\n\nAlthough baseball is a team sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure. In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: \"the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits\". Contrasting the game with both football and basketball, scholar Michael Mandelbaum argues that \"baseball is the one closest in evolutionary descent to the older individual sports\". Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it. As described by Mandelbaum,\n\n\"It is impossible to isolate and objectively assess the contribution each [football] team member makes to the outcome of the play... [E]very basketball player is interacting with all of his teammates all the time. In baseball, by contrast, every player is more or less on his own... Baseball is therefore a realm of complete transparency and total responsibility. A baseball player lives in a glass house, and in a stark moral universe... Everything that every player does is accounted for and everything accounted for is either good or bad, right or wrong.\"\n\nCricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.\n\n\n\nUnlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams following the rules of MLB and Minor League Baseball is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of 325 ft from home plate to the fences in left and right field and 400 ft to center. Major league teams often skirt even this rule. For example, at Minute Maid Park, which became the home of the Houston Astros in 2000, the Crawford Boxes in left field are only 315 ft from home plate. There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's Fenway Park, in use since 1912: the Green Monster is 310 ft from home plate down the line and 37 ft tall.\n\nSimilarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.\n\n\n\nThese physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies. Its high altitude—5282 ft above sea level—is partly responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure. Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in. The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball 330 ft into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.\n\nOrganized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, was responsible for the \"development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball.\" The statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball. In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian Alan Schwarz describes as a \"tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.\"\n\nThe Official Baseball Rules administered by MLB require the official scorer to categorize each baseball play unambiguously. The rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency. The score report is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records. General managers, managers, and baseball scouts use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions.\n\nCertain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans. The basic batting statistics include: The basic baserunning statistics include: The basic pitching statistics include: The basic fielding statistics include:\n * At bats: plate appearances, excluding walks and hit by pitches—where the batter's ability is not fully tested—and sacrifices and sacrifice flies—where the batter intentionally makes an out in order to advance one or more baserunners\n * Hits: times reached base because of a batted, fair ball without fielding error or fielder's choice\n * Runs: times circling the bases and reaching home safely\n * Runs batted in (RBIs): number of runners who scored due to a batter's action (including the batter, in the case of a home run), except when batter grounded into double play or reached on an error\n * Home runs: hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases, without the contribution of a fielding error\n * Batting average: hits divided by at bats—the traditional measure of batting ability\n * Stolen bases: times advancing to the next base entirely due to the runner's own efforts, generally while the pitcher is preparing to deliver or delivering the ball\n * Caught stealing: times tagged out while attempting to steal a base\n * Wins: credited to pitcher on winning team who last pitched before the team took a lead that it never relinquished (a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win)\n * Losses: charged to pitcher on losing team who was pitching when the opposing team took a lead that it never relinquished\n * Saves: games where the pitcher enters a game led by the pitcher's team, finishes the game without surrendering the lead, is not the winning pitcher, and either (a) the lead was three runs or less when the pitcher entered the game; (b) the potential tying run was on base, at bat, or on deck; or (c) the pitcher pitched three or more innings\n * Innings pitched: outs recorded while pitching divided by three (partial innings are conventionally recorded as, e.g., \"5.2\" or \"7.1\", the last digit actually representing thirds, not tenths, of an inning)\n * Strikeouts: times pitching three strikes to a batter\n * Winning percentage: wins divided by decisions (wins plus losses)\n * Earned run average (ERA): runs allowed, excluding those resulting from fielding errors, per nine innings pitched\n * Putouts: times the fielder catches a fly ball, tags or forces out a runner, or otherwise directly effects an out\n * Assists: times a putout by another fielder was recorded following the fielder touching the ball\n * Errors: times the fielder fails to make a play that should have been made with common effort, and the batting team benefits as a result\n * Total chances: putouts plus assists plus errors\n * Fielding average: successful chances (putouts plus assists) divided by total chances\n\nAmong the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics. For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.\n\nSabermetrics refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools. The term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves. The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, Bill James, and derives from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).\n\nThe growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average:\n * On-base percentage measures a batter's ability to get on base. It is calculated by taking the sum of the batter's successes in getting on base (hits plus walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter's total plate appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies), except for sacrifice bunts.\n * Slugging percentage measures a batter's ability to hit for power. It is calculated by taking the batter's total bases (one per each single, two per double, three per triple, and four per home run) and dividing that by the batter's at bats.\n\nSome of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use:\n * On-base plus slugging (OPS) measures a batter's overall ability. It is calculated by adding the batter's on-base percentage and slugging percentage.\n * Walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) measures a pitcher's ability at preventing hitters from reaching base. It is calculated exactly as its name suggests.\n\nWriting in 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball as America's national religion. In the words of sports columnist Jayson Stark, baseball has long been \"a unique paragon of American culture\"—a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal. Baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes \"how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba, [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in Japan.\" Since the early 1980s, the Dominican Republic, in particular the city of San Pedro de Macorís, has been the major leagues' primary source of foreign talent. In 2017, 83 of the 868 players on MLB Opening Day rosters (and disabled lists) were from the country. Among other Caribbean countries and territories, a combined 97 MLB players were born in Venezuela, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. Hall-of-Famer Roberto Clemente remains one of the greatest national heroes in Puerto Rico's history. While baseball has long been the island's primary athletic pastime, its once well-attended professional winter league has declined in popularity since 1990, when young Puerto Rican players began to be included in the major leagues' annual first-year player draft. In Asia, baseball is among the most popular sports in Japan and South Korea.\n\nThe major league game in the United States was originally targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience. A century later, the situation was very different. With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports.\n\nOverall, baseball has a large following in the United States; a 2006 poll found that nearly half of Americans are fans. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, baseball's position compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions. In 2008, MLB set a revenue record of $6.5 billion, matching the NFL's revenue for the first time in decades. A new MLB revenue record of more than $10 billion was set in 2017. On the other hand, the percentage of American sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 9%, compared to pro football at 37%. In 1985, the respective figures were pro football 24%, baseball 23%. Because there are so many more major league games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance. In 2008, total attendance at major league games was the second-highest in history: 78.6 million, 0.7% off the record set the previous year. The following year, amid the U.S. recession, attendance fell by 6.6% to 73.4 million. Eight years later, it dropped under 73 million. Attendance at games held under the Minor League Baseball umbrella set a record in 2008, with 43.3 million.\n\nIn Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues, was estimated at $1 billion in 2007. Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million. While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures were stagnant. There are concerns that MLB's growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country. In Cuba, where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport, the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top-level domestic leagues. Revenue figures are not released for the country's amateur system. Similarly, according to one official pronouncement, the sport's governing authority \"has never taken into account attendance ... because its greatest interest has always been the development of athletes\".\n\n, Little League Baseball oversees leagues with close to 2.4 million participants in over 80 countries. The number of players has fallen since the 1990s, when 3 million children took part in Little League Baseball annually. Babe Ruth League teams have over 1 million participants. According to the president of the International Baseball Federation, between 300,000 and 500,000 women and girls play baseball around the world, including Little League and the introductory game of Tee Ball.\n\nA varsity baseball team is an established part of physical education departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2015, nearly half a million high schoolers and over 34,000 collegians played on their schools' baseball teams. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.\n\n\n\nBaseball has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the United States and elsewhere. Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game is the source of a number of widely used sexual euphemisms. The first networked radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City's Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by wire to WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts. The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.\n\nBaseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment. One of the first major examples, Ernest Thayer's poem \"Casey at the Bat\", appeared in 1888. A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a \"clutch situation\", the poem became the source of vaudeville and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. There have been many baseball movies, including the Academy Award–winning The Pride of the Yankees (1942) and the Oscar nominees The Natural (1984) and Field of Dreams (1989). The American Film Institute's selection of the ten best sports movies includes The Pride of the Yankees at number 3 and Bull Durham (1988) at number 5. Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage—the Adler–Ross musical Damn Yankees—and record—George J. Gaskin's \"Slide, Kelly, Slide\", Simon and Garfunkel's \"Mrs. Robinson\", and John Fogerty's \"Centerfield\". The baseball-inspired comedic sketch \"Who's on First\", popularized by Abbott and Costello in 1938, quickly became famous. Six decades later, Time named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century.\n\nLiterary works connected to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (the source for the movie), Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop., and W. P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe (the source for Field of Dreams). Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of Damon Runyon; the columns of Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, and Peter Gammons; and the essays of Roger Angell. Among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are Lawrence S. Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, and Michael Lewis's Moneyball. The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton's tell-all chronicle Ball Four is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports.\n\nBaseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example featured an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.\n\nModern fantasy sports began in 1980 with the invention of Rotisserie League Baseball by New York writer Daniel Okrent and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active MLB players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as fantasy baseball, it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports. The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports-related websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800 million on the hobby. The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.\n\n","\n'Talking of Exhibitions, World's Fairs, and what not,' said the old\ngentleman, 'I would not go round the corner to see a dozen of them\nnowadays.  The only exhibition that ever made, or ever will make, any\nimpression upon my imagination was the first of the series, the parent of\nthem all, and now a thing of old times--the Great Exhibition of 1851, in\nHyde Park, London.  None of the younger generation can realize the sense\nof novelty it produced in us who were then in our prime.  A noun\nsubstantive went so far as to become an adjective in honour of the\noccasion.  It was \"exhibition\" hat, \"exhibition\" razor-strop,\n\"exhibition\" watch; nay, even \"exhibition\" weather, \"exhibition\" spirits,\nsweethearts, babies, wives--for the time.\n\n'For South Wessex, the year formed in many ways an extraordinary\nchronological frontier or transit-line, at which there occurred what one\nmight call a precipice in Time.  As in a geological \"fault,\" we had\npresented to us a sudden bringing of ancient and modern into absolute\ncontact, such as probably in no other single year since the Conquest was\never witnessed in this part of the country.'\n\nThese observations led us onward to talk of the different personages,\ngentle and simple, who lived and moved within our narrow and peaceful\nhorizon at that time; and of three people in particular, whose queer\nlittle history was oddly touched at points by the Exhibition, more\nconcerned with it than that of anybody else who dwelt in those outlying\nshades of the world, Stickleford, Mellstock, and Egdon.  First in\nprominence among these three came Wat Ollamoor--if that were his real\nname--whom the seniors in our party had known well.\n\nHe was a woman's man, they said,--supremely so--externally little else.\nTo men he was not attractive; perhaps a little repulsive at times.\nMusician, dandy, and company-man in practice; veterinary surgeon in\ntheory, he lodged awhile in Mellstock village, coming from nobody knew\nwhere; though some said his first appearance in this neighbourhood had\nbeen as fiddle-player in a show at Greenhill Fair.\n\nMany a worthy villager envied him his power over unsophisticated\nmaidenhood--a power which seemed sometimes to have a touch of the weird\nand wizardly in it.  Personally he was not ill-favoured, though rather un-\nEnglish, his complexion being a rich olive, his rank hair dark and rather\nclammy--made still clammier by secret ointments, which, when he came\nfresh to a party, caused him to smell like 'boys'-love' (southernwood)\nsteeped in lamp-oil.  On occasion he wore curls--a double row--running\nalmost horizontally around his head.  But as these were sometimes\nnoticeably absent, it was concluded that they were not altogether of\nNature's making.  By girls whose love for him had turned to hatred he had\nbeen nicknamed 'Mop,' from this abundance of hair, which was long enough\nto rest upon his shoulders; as time passed the name more and more\nprevailed.\n\nHis fiddling possibly had the most to do with the fascination he\nexercised, for, to speak fairly, it could claim for itself a most\npeculiar and personal quality, like that in a moving preacher.  There\nwere tones in it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and\naverseness to systematic application were all that lay between 'Mop' and\nthe career of a second Paganini.\n\nWhile playing he invariably closed his eyes; using no notes, and, as it\nwere, allowing the violin to wander on at will into the most plaintive\npassages ever heard by rustic man.  There was a certain lingual character\nin the supplicatory expressions he produced, which would well nigh have\ndrawn an ache from the heart of a gate-post.  He could make any child in\nthe parish, who was at all sensitive to music, burst into tears in a few\nminutes by simply fiddling one of the old dance-tunes he almost entirely\naffected--country jigs, reels, and 'Favourite Quick Steps' of the last\ncentury--some mutilated remains of which even now reappear as nameless\nphantoms in new quadrilles and gallops, where they are recognized only by\nthe curious, or by such old-fashioned and far-between people as have been\nthrown with men like Wat Ollamoor in their early life.\n\nHis date was a little later than that of the old Mellstock quire-band\nwhich comprised the Dewys, Mail, and the rest--in fact, he did not rise\nabove the horizon thereabout till those well-known musicians were\ndisbanded as ecclesiastical functionaries.  In their honest love of\nthoroughness they despised the new man's style.  Theophilus Dewy (Reuben\nthe tranter's younger brother) used to say there was no 'plumness' in\nit--no bowing, no solidity--it was all fantastical.  And probably this\nwas true.  Anyhow, Mop had, very obviously, never bowed a note of church-\nmusic from his birth; he never once sat in the gallery of Mellstock\nchurch where the others had tuned their venerable psalmody so many\nhundreds of times; had never, in all likelihood, entered a church at all.\nAll were devil's tunes in his repertory.  'He could no more play the Wold\nHundredth to his true time than he could play the brazen serpent,' the\ntranter would say.  (The brazen serpent was supposed in Mellstock to be a\nmusical instrument particularly hard to blow.)\n\nOccasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the souls\nof grown-up persons, especially young women of fragile and responsive\norganization.  Such an one was Car'line Aspent.  Though she was already\nengaged to be married before she met him, Car'line, of them all, was the\nmost influenced by Mop Ollamoor's heart-stealing melodies, to her\ndiscomfort, nay, positive pain and ultimate injury.  She was a pretty,\ninvocating, weak-mouthed girl, whose chief defect as a companion with her\nsex was a tendency to peevishness now and then.  At this time she was not\na resident in Mellstock parish where Mop lodged, but lived some miles off\nat Stickleford, farther down the river.\n\nHow and where she first made acquaintance with him and his fiddling is\nnot truly known, but the story was that it either began or was developed\non one spring evening, when, in passing through Lower Mellstock, she\nchanced to pause on the bridge near his house to rest herself, and\nlanguidly leaned over the parapet.  Mop was standing on his door-step, as\nwas his custom, spinning the insidious thread of semi- and\ndemi-semi-quavers from the E string of his fiddle for the benefit of\npassers-by, and laughing as the tears rolled down the cheeks of the\nlittle children hanging around him.  Car'line pretended to be engrossed\nwith the rippling of the stream under the arches, but in reality she was\nlistening, as he knew.  Presently the aching of the heart seized her\nsimultaneously with a wild desire to glide airily in the mazes of an\ninfinite dance.  To shake off the fascination she resolved to go on,\nalthough it would be necessary to pass him as he played.  On stealthily\nglancing ahead at the performer, she found to her relief that his eyes\nwere closed in abandonment to instrumentation, and she strode on boldly.\nBut when closer her step grew timid, her tread convulsed itself more and\nmore accordantly with the time of the melody, till she very nearly danced\nalong.  Gaining another glance at him when immediately opposite, she saw\nthat _one_ of his eyes was open, quizzing her as he smiled at her\nemotional state.  Her gait could not divest itself of its compelled\ncapers till she had gone a long way past the house; and Car'line was\nunable to shake off the strange infatuation for hours.\n\nAfter that day, whenever there was to be in the neighbourhood a dance to\nwhich she could get an invitation, and where Mop Ollamoor was to be the\nmusician, Car'line contrived to be present, though it sometimes involved\na walk of several miles; for he did not play so often in Stickleford as\nelsewhere.\n\nThe next evidences of his influence over her were singular enough, and it\nwould require a neurologist to fully explain them.  She would be sitting\nquietly, any evening after dark, in the house of her father, the parish\nclerk, which stood in the middle of Stickleford village street, this\nbeing the highroad between Lower Mellstock and Moreford, five miles\neastward.  Here, without a moment's warning, and in the midst of a\ngeneral conversation between her father, sister, and the young man before\nalluded to, who devotedly wooed her in ignorance of her infatuation, she\nwould start from her seat in the chimney-corner as if she had received a\ngalvanic shock, and spring convulsively towards the ceiling; then she\nwould burst into tears, and it was not till some half-hour had passed\nthat she grew calm as usual.  Her father, knowing her hysterical\ntendencies, was always excessively anxious about this trait in his\nyoungest girl, and feared the attack to be a species of epileptic fit.\nNot so her sister Julia.  Julia had found out what was the cause.  At the\nmoment before the jumping, only an exceptionally sensitive ear situated\nin the chimney-nook could have caught from down the flue the beat of a\nman's footstep along the highway without.  But it was in that footfall,\nfor which she had been waiting, that the origin of Car'line's involuntary\nspringing lay.  The pedestrian was Mop Ollamoor, as the girl well knew;\nbut his business that way was not to visit her; he sought another woman\nwhom he spoke of as his Intended, and who lived at Moreford, two miles\nfarther on.  On one, and only one, occasion did it happen that Car'line\ncould not control her utterance; it was when her sister alone chanced to\nbe present.  'Oh--oh--oh--!' she cried.  'He's going to _her_, and not\ncoming to _me_!'\n\nTo do the fiddler justice he had not at first thought greatly of, or\nspoken much to, this girl of impressionable mould.  But he had soon found\nout her secret, and could not resist a little by-play with her too easily\nhurt heart, as an interlude between his more serious performances at\nMoreford.  The two became well acquainted, though only by stealth, hardly\na soul in Stickleford except her sister, and her lover Ned Hipcroft,\nbeing aware of the attachment.  Her father disapproved of her coldness to\nNed; her sister, too, hoped she might get over this nervous passion for a\nman of whom so little was known.  The ultimate result was that Car'line's\nmanly and simple wooer Edward found his suit becoming practically\nhopeless.  He was a respectable mechanic, in a far sounder position than\nMop the nominal horse-doctor; but when, before leaving her, Ned put his\nflat and final question, would she marry him, then and there, now or\nnever, it was with little expectation of obtaining more than the negative\nshe gave him.  Though her father supported him and her sister supported\nhim, he could not play the fiddle so as to draw your soul out of your\nbody like a spider's thread, as Mop did, till you felt as limp as withy-\nwind and yearned for something to cling to.  Indeed, Hipcroft had not the\nslightest ear for music; could not sing two notes in tune, much less play\nthem.\n\nThe No he had expected and got from her, in spite of a preliminary\nencouragement, gave Ned a new start in life.  It had been uttered in such\na tone of sad entreaty that he resolved to persecute her no more; she\nshould not even be distressed by a sight of his form in the distant\nperspective of the street and lane.  He left the place, and his natural\ncourse was to London.\n\nThe railway to South Wessex was in process of construction, but it was\nnot as yet opened for traffic; and Hipcroft reached the capital by a six\ndays' trudge on foot, as many a better man had done before him.  He was\none of the last of the artisan class who used that now extinct method of\ntravel to the great centres of labour, so customary then from time\nimmemorial.\n\nIn London he lived and worked regularly at his trade.  More fortunate\nthan many, his disinterested willingness recommended him from the first.\nDuring the ensuing four years he was never out of employment.  He neither\nadvanced nor receded in the modern sense; he improved as a workman, but\nhe did not shift one jot in social position.  About his love for Car'line\nhe maintained a rigid silence.  No doubt he often thought of her; but\nbeing always occupied, and having no relations at Stickleford, he held no\ncommunication with that part of the country, and showed no desire to\nreturn.  In his quiet lodging in Lambeth he moved about after working-\nhours with the facility of a woman, doing his own cooking, attending to\nhis stocking-heels, and shaping himself by degrees to a life-long\nbachelorhood.  For this conduct one is bound to advance the canonical\nreason that time could not efface from his heart the image of little\nCar'line Aspent--and it may be in part true; but there was also the\ninference that his was a nature not greatly dependent upon the\nministrations of the other sex for its comforts.\n\nThe fourth year of his residence as a mechanic in London was the year of\nthe Hyde-Park Exhibition already mentioned, and at the construction of\nthis huge glass-house, then unexampled in the world's history, he worked\ndaily.  It was an era of great hope and activity among the nations and\nindustries.  Though Hipcroft was, in his small way, a central man in the\nmovement, he plodded on with his usual outward placidity.  Yet for him,\ntoo, the year was destined to have its surprises, for when the bustle of\ngetting the building ready for the opening day was past, the ceremonies\nhad been witnessed, and people were flocking thither from all parts of\nthe globe, he received a letter from Car'line.  Till that day the silence\nof four years between himself and Stickleford had never been broken.\n\nShe informed her old lover, in an uncertain penmanship which suggested a\ntrembling hand, of the trouble she had been put to in ascertaining his\naddress, and then broached the subject which had prompted her to write.\nFour years ago, she said with the greatest delicacy of which she was\ncapable, she had been so foolish as to refuse him.  Her wilful\nwrong-headedness had since been a grief to her many times, and of late\nparticularly.  As for Mr. Ollamoor, he had been absent almost as long as\nNed--she did not know where.  She would gladly marry Ned now if he were\nto ask her again, and be a tender little wife to him till her life's end.\n\nA tide of warm feeling must have surged through Ned Hipcroft's frame on\nreceipt of this news, if we may judge by the issue.  Unquestionably he\nloved her still, even if not to the exclusion of every other happiness.\nThis from his Car'line, she who had been dead to him these many years,\nalive to him again as of old, was in itself a pleasant, gratifying thing.\nNed had grown so resigned to, or satisfied with, his lonely lot, that he\nprobably would not have shown much jubilation at anything.  Still, a\ncertain ardour of preoccupation, after his first surprise, revealed how\ndeeply her confession of faith in him had stirred him.  Measured and\nmethodical in his ways, he did not answer the letter that day, nor the\nnext, nor the next.  He was having 'a good think.'  When he did answer\nit, there was a great deal of sound reasoning mixed in with the\nunmistakable tenderness of his reply; but the tenderness itself was\nsufficient to reveal that he was pleased with her straightforward\nfrankness; that the anchorage she had once obtained in his heart was\nrenewable, if it had not been continuously firm.\n\nHe told her--and as he wrote his lips twitched humorously over the few\ngentle words of raillery he indited among the rest of his sentences--that\nit was all very well for her to come round at this time of day.  Why\nwouldn't she have him when he wanted her?  She had no doubt learned that\nhe was not married, but suppose his affections had since been fixed on\nanother?  She ought to beg his pardon.  Still, he was not the man to\nforget her.  But considering how he had been used, and what he had\nsuffered, she could not quite expect him to go down to Stickleford and\nfetch her.  But if she would come to him, and say she was sorry, as was\nonly fair; why, yes, he would marry her, knowing what a good little woman\nshe was at the core.  He added that the request for her to come to him\nwas a less one to make than it would have been when he first left\nStickleford, or even a few months ago; for the new railway into South\nWessex was now open, and there had just begun to be run wonderfully\ncontrived special trains, called excursion-trains, on account of the\nGreat Exhibition; so that she could come up easily alone.\n\nShe said in her reply how good it was of him to treat her so generously,\nafter her hot and cold treatment of him; that though she felt frightened\nat the magnitude of the journey, and was never as yet in a railway-train,\nhaving only seen one pass at a distance, she embraced his offer with all\nher heart; and would, indeed, own to him how sorry she was, and beg his\npardon, and try to be a good wife always, and make up for lost time.\n\nThe remaining details of when and where were soon settled, Car'line\ninforming him, for her ready identification in the crowd, that she would\nbe wearing 'my new sprigged-laylock cotton gown,' and Ned gaily\nresponding that, having married her the morning after her arrival, he\nwould make a day of it by taking her to the Exhibition.  One early summer\nafternoon, accordingly, he came from his place of work, and hastened\ntowards Waterloo Station to meet her.  It was as wet and chilly as an\nEnglish June day can occasionally be, but as he waited on the platform in\nthe drizzle he glowed inwardly, and seemed to have something to live for\nagain.\n\nThe 'excursion-train'--an absolutely new departure in the history of\ntravel--was still a novelty on the Wessex line, and probably everywhere.\nCrowds of people had flocked to all the stations on the way up to witness\nthe unwonted sight of so long a train's passage, even where they did not\ntake advantage of the opportunity it offered.  The seats for the humbler\nclass of travellers in these early experiments in steam-locomotion, were\nopen trucks, without any protection whatever from the wind and rain; and\ndamp weather having set in with the afternoon, the unfortunate occupants\nof these vehicles were, on the train drawing up at the London terminus,\nfound to be in a pitiable condition from their long journey; blue-faced,\nstiff-necked, sneezing, rain-beaten, chilled to the marrow, many of the\nmen being hatless; in fact, they resembled people who had been out all\nnight in an open boat on a rough sea, rather than inland excursionists\nfor pleasure.  The women had in some degree protected themselves by\nturning up the skirts of their gowns over their heads, but as by this\narrangement they were additionally exposed about the hips, they were all\nmore or less in a sorry plight.\n\nIn the bustle and crush of alighting forms of both sexes which followed\nthe entry of the huge concatenation into the station, Ned Hipcroft soon\ndiscerned the slim little figure his eye was in search of, in the\nsprigged lilac, as described.  She came up to him with a frightened\nsmile--still pretty, though so damp, weather-beaten, and shivering from\nlong exposure to the wind.\n\n'O Ned!' she sputtered, 'I--I--'  He clasped her in his arms and kissed\nher, whereupon she burst into a flood of tears.\n\n'You are wet, my poor dear!  I hope you'll not get cold,' he said.  And\nsurveying her and her multifarious surrounding packages, he noticed that\nby the hand she led a toddling child--a little girl of three or so--whose\nhood was as clammy and tender face as blue as those of the other\ntravellers.\n\n'Who is this--somebody you know?' asked Ned curiously.\n\n'Yes, Ned.  She's mine.'\n\n'Yours?'\n\n'Yes--my own!'\n\n'Your own child?'\n\n'Yes!'\n\n'Well--as God's in--'\n\n'Ned, I didn't name it in my letter, because, you see, it would have been\nso hard to explain!  I thought that when we met I could tell you how she\nhappened to be born, so much better than in writing!  I hope you'll\nexcuse it this once, dear Ned, and not scold me, now I've come so many,\nmany miles!'\n\n'This means Mr. Mop Ollamoor, I reckon!' said Hipcroft, gazing palely at\nthem from the distance of the yard or two to which he had withdrawn with\na start.\n\nCar'line gasped.  'But he's been gone away for years!' she supplicated.\n'And I never had a young man before!  And I was so onlucky to be catched\nthe first time, though some of the girls down there go on like anything!'\n\nNed remained in silence, pondering.\n\n'You'll forgive me, dear Ned?' she added, beginning to sob outright.  'I\nhaven't taken 'ee in after all, because--because you can pack us back\nagain, if you want to; though 'tis hundreds o' miles, and so wet, and\nnight a-coming on, and I with no money!'\n\n'What the devil can I do!' Hipcroft groaned.\n\nA more pitiable picture than the pair of helpless creatures presented was\nnever seen on a rainy day, as they stood on the great, gaunt, puddled\nplatform, a whiff of drizzle blowing under the roof upon them now and\nthen; the pretty attire in which they had started from Stickleford in the\nearly morning bemuddled and sodden, weariness on their faces, and fear of\nhim in their eyes; for the child began to look as if she thought she too\nhad done some wrong, remaining in an appalled silence till the tears\nrolled down her chubby cheeks.\n\n'What's the matter, my little maid?' said Ned mechanically.\n\n'I do want to go home!' she let out, in tones that told of a bursting\nheart.  'And my totties be cold, an' I shan't have no bread an' butter no\nmore!'\n\n'I don't know what to say to it all!' declared Ned, his own eye moist as\nhe turned and walked a few steps with his head down; then regarded them\nagain point blank.  From the child escaped troubled breaths and silently\nwelling tears.\n\n'Want some bread and butter, do 'ee?' he said, with factitious hardness.\n\n'Ye-e-s!'\n\n'Well, I daresay I can get 'ee a bit!  Naturally, you must want some.  And\nyou, too, for that matter, Car'line.'\n\n'I do feel a little hungered.  But I can keep it off,' she murmured.\n\n'Folk shouldn't do that,' he said gruffly. . . . 'There come along!' he\ncaught up the child, as he added, 'You must bide here to-night, anyhow, I\ns'pose!  What can you do otherwise?  I'll get 'ee some tea and victuals;\nand as for this job, I'm sure I don't know what to say!  This is the way\nout.'\n\nThey pursued their way, without speaking, to Ned's lodgings, which were\nnot far off.  There he dried them and made them comfortable, and prepared\ntea; they thankfully sat down.  The ready-made household of which he\nsuddenly found himself the head imparted a cosy aspect to his room, and a\npaternal one to himself.  Presently he turned to the child and kissed her\nnow blooming cheeks; and, looking wistfully at Car'line, kissed her also.\n\n'I don't see how I can send 'ee back all them miles,' he growled, 'now\nyou've come all the way o' purpose to join me.  But you must trust me,\nCar'line, and show you've real faith in me.  Well, do you feel better\nnow, my little woman?'\n\nThe child nodded, her mouth being otherwise occupied.\n\n'I did trust you, Ned, in coming; and I shall always!'\n\nThus, without any definite agreement to forgive her, he tacitly\nacquiesced in the fate that Heaven had sent him; and on the day of their\nmarriage (which was not quite so soon as he had expected it could be, on\naccount of the time necessary for banns) he took her to the Exhibition\nwhen they came back from church, as he had promised.  While standing near\na large mirror in one of the courts devoted to furniture, Car'line\nstarted, for in the glass appeared the reflection of a form exactly\nresembling Mop Ollamoor's--so exactly, that it seemed impossible to\nbelieve anybody but that artist in person to be the original.  On passing\nround the objects which hemmed in Ned, her, and the child from a direct\nview, no Mop was to be seen.  Whether he were really in London or not at\nthat time was never known; and Car'line always stoutly denied that her\nreadiness to go and meet Ned in town arose from any rumour that Mop had\nalso gone thither; which denial there was no reasonable ground for\ndoubting.\n\nAnd then the year glided away, and the Exhibition folded itself up and\nbecame a thing of the past.  The park trees that had been enclosed for\nsix months were again exposed to the winds and storms, and the sod grew\ngreen anew.  Ned found that Car'line resolved herself into a very good\nwife and companion, though she had made herself what is called cheap to\nhim; but in that she was like another domestic article, a cheap tea-pot,\nwhich often brews better tea than a dear one.  One autumn Hipcroft found\nhimself with but little work to do, and a prospect of less for the\nwinter.  Both being country born and bred, they fancied they would like\nto live again in their natural atmosphere.  It was accordingly decided\nbetween them that they should leave the pent-up London lodging, and that\nNed should seek out employment near his native place, his wife and her\ndaughter staying with Car'line's father during the search for occupation\nand an abode of their own.\n\nTinglings of pleasure pervaded Car'line's spasmodic little frame as she\njourneyed down with Ned to the place she had left two or three years\nbefore, in silence and under a cloud.  To return to where she had once\nbeen despised, a smiling London wife with a distinct London accent, was a\ntriumph which the world did not witness every day.\n\nThe train did not stop at the petty roadside station that lay nearest to\nStickleford, and the trio went on to Casterbridge.  Ned thought it a good\nopportunity to make a few preliminary inquiries for employment at\nworkshops in the borough where he had been known; and feeling cold from\nher journey, and it being dry underfoot and only dusk as yet, with a moon\non the point of rising, Car'line and her little girl walked on toward\nStickleford, leaving Ned to follow at a quicker pace, and pick her up at\na certain half-way house, widely known as an inn.\n\nThe woman and child pursued the well-remembered way comfortably enough,\nthough they were both becoming wearied.  In the course of three miles\nthey had passed Heedless-William's Pond, the familiar landmark by Bloom's\nEnd, and were drawing near the Quiet Woman Inn, a lone roadside hostel on\nthe lower verge of the Egdon Heath, since and for many years abolished.\nIn stepping up towards it Car'line heard more voices within than had\nformerly been customary at such an hour, and she learned that an auction\nof fat stock had been held near the spot that afternoon.  The child would\nbe the better for a rest as well as herself, she thought, and she\nentered.\n\nThe guests and customers overflowed into the passage, and Car'line had no\nsooner crossed the threshold than a man whom she remembered by sight came\nforward with glass and mug in his hands towards a friend leaning against\nthe wall; but, seeing her, very gallantly offered her a drink of the\nliquor, which was gin-and-beer hot, pouring her out a tumblerful and\nsaying, in a moment or two: 'Surely, 'tis little Car'line Aspent that\nwas--down at Stickleford?'\n\nShe assented, and, though she did not exactly want this beverage, she\ndrank it since it was offered, and her entertainer begged her to come in\nfarther and sit down.  Once within the room she found that all the\npersons present were seated close against the walls, and there being a\nchair vacant she did the same.  An explanation of their position occurred\nthe next moment.  In the opposite corner stood Mop, rosining his bow and\nlooking just the same as ever.  The company had cleared the middle of the\nroom for dancing, and they were about to dance again.  As she wore a veil\nto keep off the wind she did not think he had recognized her, or could\npossibly guess the identity of the child; and to her satisfied surprise\nshe found that she could confront him quite calmly--mistress of herself\nin the dignity her London life had given her.  Before she had quite\nemptied her glass the dance was called, the dancers formed in two lines,\nthe music sounded, and the figure began.\n\nThen matters changed for Car'line.  A tremor quickened itself to life in\nher, and her hand so shook that she could hardly set down her glass.  It\nwas not the dance nor the dancers, but the notes of that old violin which\nthrilled the London wife, these having still all the witchery that she\nhad so well known of yore, and under which she had used to lose her power\nof independent will.  How it all came back!  There was the fiddling\nfigure against the wall; the large, oily, mop-like head of him, and\nbeneath the mop the face with closed eyes.\n\nAfter the first moments of paralyzed reverie the familiar tune in the\nfamiliar rendering made her laugh and shed tears simultaneously.  Then a\nman at the bottom of the dance, whose partner had dropped away, stretched\nout his hand and beckoned to her to take the place.  She did not want to\ndance; she entreated by signs to be left where she was, but she was\nentreating of the tune and its player rather than of the dancing man.  The\nsaltatory tendency which the fiddler and his cunning instrument had ever\nbeen able to start in her was seizing Car'line just as it had done in\nearlier years, possibly assisted by the gin-and-beer hot.  Tired as she\nwas she grasped her little girl by the hand, and plunging in at the\nbottom of the figure, whirled about with the rest.  She found that her\ncompanions were mostly people of the neighbouring hamlets and\nfarms--Bloom's End, Mellstock, Lewgate, and elsewhere; and by degrees she\nwas recognized as she convulsively danced on, wishing that Mop would\ncease and let her heart rest from the aching he caused, and her feet\nalso.\n\nAfter long and many minutes the dance ended, when she was urged to\nfortify herself with more gin-and-beer; which she did, feeling very weak\nand overpowered with hysteric emotion.  She refrained from unveiling, to\nkeep Mop in ignorance of her presence, if possible.  Several of the\nguests having left, Car'line hastily wiped her lips and also turned to\ngo; but, according to the account of some who remained, at that very\nmoment a five-handed reel was proposed, in which two or three begged her\nto join.\n\nShe declined on the plea of being tired and having to walk to\nStickleford, when Mop began aggressively tweedling 'My Fancy-Lad,' in D\nmajor, as the air to which the reel was to be footed.  He must have\nrecognized her, though she did not know it, for it was the strain of all\nseductive strains which she was least able to resist--the one he had\nplayed when she was leaning over the bridge at the date of their first\nacquaintance.  Car'line stepped despairingly into the middle of the room\nwith the other four.\n\nReels were resorted to hereabouts at this time by the more robust\nspirits, for the reduction of superfluous energy which the ordinary\nfigure-dances were not powerful enough to exhaust.  As everybody knows,\nor does not know, the five reelers stood in the form of a cross, the reel\nbeing performed by each line of three alternately, the persons who\nsuccessively came to the middle place dancing in both directions.\nCar'line soon found herself in this place, the axis of the whole\nperformance, and could not get out of it, the tune turning into the first\npart without giving her opportunity.  And now she began to suspect that\nMop did know her, and was doing this on purpose, though whenever she\nstole a glance at him his closed eyes betokened obliviousness to\neverything outside his own brain.  She continued to wend her way through\nthe figure of 8 that was formed by her course, the fiddler introducing\ninto his notes the wild and agonizing sweetness of a living voice in one\ntoo highly wrought; its pathos running high and running low in endless\nvariation, projecting through her nerves excruciating spasms, a sort of\nblissful torture.  The room swam, the tune was endless; and in about a\nquarter of an hour the only other woman in the figure dropped out\nexhausted, and sank panting on a bench.\n\nThe reel instantly resolved itself into a four-handed one.  Car'line\nwould have given anything to leave off; but she had, or fancied she had,\nno power, while Mop played such tunes; and thus another ten minutes\nslipped by, a haze of dust now clouding the candles, the floor being of\nstone, sanded.  Then another dancer fell out--one of the men--and went\ninto the passage, in a frantic search for liquor.  To turn the figure\ninto a three-handed reel was the work of a second, Mop modulating at the\nsame time into 'The Fairy Dance,' as better suited to the contracted\nmovement, and no less one of those foods of love which, as manufactured\nby his bow, had always intoxicated her.\n\nIn a reel for three there was no rest whatever, and four or five minutes\nwere enough to make her remaining two partners, now thoroughly blown,\nstamp their last bar and, like their predecessors, limp off into the next\nroom to get something to drink.  Car'line, half-stifled inside her veil,\nwas left dancing alone, the apartment now being empty of everybody save\nherself, Mop, and their little girl.\n\nShe flung up the veil, and cast her eyes upon him, as if imploring him to\nwithdraw himself and his acoustic magnetism from the atmosphere.  Mop\nopened one of his own orbs, as though for the first time, fixed it\npeeringly upon her, and smiling dreamily, threw into his strains the\nreserve of expression which he could not afford to waste on a big and\nnoisy dance.  Crowds of little chromatic subtleties, capable of drawing\ntears from a statue, proceeded straightway from the ancient fiddle, as if\nit were dying of the emotion which had been pent up within it ever since\nits banishment from some Italian city where it first took shape and\nsound.  There was that in the look of Mop's one dark eye which said: 'You\ncannot leave off, dear, whether you would or no!' and it bred in her a\nparoxysm of desperation that defied him to tire her down.\n\nShe thus continued to dance alone, defiantly as she thought, but in truth\nslavishly and abjectly, subject to every wave of the melody, and probed\nby the gimlet-like gaze of her fascinator's open eye; keeping up at the\nsame time a feeble smile in his face, as a feint to signify it was still\nher own pleasure which led her on.  A terrified embarrassment as to what\nshe could say to him if she were to leave off, had its unrecognized share\nin keeping her going.  The child, who was beginning to be distressed by\nthe strange situation, came up and said: 'Stop, mother, stop, and let's\ngo home!' as she seized Car'line's hand.\n\nSuddenly Car'line sank staggering to the floor; and rolling over on her\nface, prone she remained.  Mop's fiddle thereupon emitted an elfin shriek\nof finality; stepping quickly down from the nine-gallon beer-cask which\nhad formed his rostrum, he went to the little girl, who disconsolately\nbent over her mother.\n\nThe guests who had gone into the back-room for liquor and change of air,\nhearing something unusual, trooped back hitherward, where they\nendeavoured to revive poor, weak Car'line by blowing her with the bellows\nand opening the window.  Ned, her husband, who had been detained in\nCasterbridge, as aforesaid, came along the road at this juncture, and\nhearing excited voices through the open casement, and to his great\nsurprise, the mention of his wife's name, he entered amid the rest upon\nthe scene.  Car'line was now in convulsions, weeping violently, and for a\nlong time nothing could be done with her.  While he was sending for a\ncart to take her onward to Stickleford Hipcroft anxiously inquired how it\nhad all happened; and then the assembly explained that a fiddler formerly\nknown in the locality had lately revisited his old haunts, and had taken\nupon himself without invitation to play that evening at the inn.\n\nNed demanded the fiddler's name, and they said Ollamoor.\n\n'Ah!' exclaimed Ned, looking round him.  'Where is he, and where--where's\nmy little girl?'\n\nOllamoor had disappeared, and so had the child.  Hipcroft was in ordinary\na quiet and tractable fellow, but a determination which was to be feared\nsettled in his face now.  'Blast him!' he cried.  'I'll beat his skull in\nfor'n, if I swing for it to-morrow!'\n\nHe had rushed to the poker which lay on the hearth, and hastened down the\npassage, the people following.  Outside the house, on the other side of\nthe highway, a mass of dark heath-land rose sullenly upward to its not\neasily accessible interior, a ravined plateau, whereon jutted into the\nsky, at the distance of a couple of miles, the fir-woods of Mistover\nbacked by the Yalbury coppices--a place of Dantesque gloom at this hour,\nwhich would have afforded secure hiding for a battery of artillery, much\nless a man and a child.\n\nSome other men plunged thitherward with him, and more went along the\nroad.  They were gone about twenty minutes altogether, returning without\nresult to the inn.  Ned sat down in the settle, and clasped his forehead\nwith his hands.\n\n'Well--what a fool the man is, and hev been all these years, if he thinks\nthe child his, as a' do seem to!' they whispered.  'And everybody else\nknowing otherwise!'\n\n'No, I don't think 'tis mine!' cried Ned hoarsely, as he looked up from\nhis hands.  'But she is mine, all the same!  Ha'n't I nussed her?  Ha'n't\nI fed her and teached her?  Ha'n't I played wi' her?  O, little\nCarry--gone with that rogue--gone!'\n\n'You ha'n't lost your mis'ess, anyhow,' they said to console him.  'She's\nthrowed up the sperrits, and she is feeling better, and she's more to 'ee\nthan a child that isn't yours.'\n\n'She isn't!  She's not so particular much to me, especially now she's\nlost the little maid!  But Carry's everything!'\n\n'Well, ver' like you'll find her to-morrow.'\n\n'Ah--but shall I?  Yet he _can't_ hurt her--surely he can't!  Well--how's\nCar'line now?  I am ready.  Is the cart here?'\n\nShe was lifted into the vehicle, and they sadly lumbered on toward\nStickleford.  Next day she was calmer; but the fits were still upon her;\nand her will seemed shattered.  For the child she appeared to show\nsingularly little anxiety, though Ned was nearly distracted.  It was\nnevertheless quite expected that the impish Mop would restore the lost\none after a freak of a day or two; but time went on, and neither he nor\nshe could be heard of, and Hipcroft murmured that perhaps he was\nexercising upon her some unholy musical charm, as he had done upon\nCar'line herself.  Weeks passed, and still they could obtain no clue\neither to the fiddler's whereabouts or the girl's; and how he could have\ninduced her to go with him remained a mystery.\n\nThen Ned, who had obtained only temporary employment in the\nneighbourhood, took a sudden hatred toward his native district, and a\nrumour reaching his ears through the police that a somewhat similar man\nand child had been seen at a fair near London, he playing a violin, she\ndancing on stilts, a new interest in the capital took possession of\nHipcroft with an intensity which would scarcely allow him time to pack\nbefore returning thither.\n\nHe did not, however, find the lost one, though he made it the entire\nbusiness of his over-hours to stand about in by-streets in the hope of\ndiscovering her, and would start up in the night, saying, 'That rascal's\ntorturing her to maintain him!'  To which his wife would answer\npeevishly, 'Don't 'ee raft yourself so, Ned!  You prevent my getting a\nbit o' rest!  He won't hurt her!' and fall asleep again.\n\nThat Carry and her father had emigrated to America was the general\nopinion; Mop, no doubt, finding the girl a highly desirable companion\nwhen he had trained her to keep him by her earnings as a dancer.  There,\nfor that matter, they may be performing in some capacity now, though he\nmust be an old scamp verging on threescore-and-ten, and she a woman of\nfour-and-forty.\n\n","I had been researching LSD online for months during my senior year in High School because I had a strong desire to take LSD and experience all the effects I was reading about.\n\nThe summer came, and we were out of school until college. About the second day out of school, I discovered some LSD at 9 AM in the morning. Whether I had eaten breakfast or not I don't remember, but i would guess NO. I was shocked looking at the two little green gel tabs, I put them in my mouth without hesitation and felt them disolve. OH WOW i thought before any of the effects kicked in, I just ate something that's going to make me trip for hours and hours seeing everything I've ever wanted to!\n\nHere I will give my previous drug experience:\nI had smoked endless amounts of pot just about every day starting about mid-junior year. I had eaten ecstacy about 5 times and I always felt uncomfortable getting an unnatural ecstatic emotion, and ecstacy is just bad for you, I say, and so does the evidence showing severe brain damage. Also at that point I had had one fun yet mild mushroom experience.\n\nI sat down at the computer to play an online game. I played about 15 minutes until the anticipation really kicked in. I started getting shaky and VERY ANXIOUS. I turned around and saw fishing poles in the corner of the room, they were taller than ever before and they towered over everything! At this point I figured I should go check things out, it's coming on. I got down on the floor and looked at my imitation oriental rug to see what was seen in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the pattern rose off the carpet, my eyes were really starting to play tricks on me.\n\nI need a shower. I get in the bathroom and the towels are breathing and pulsating, my vision was wacky. I could see small areas blown up very big and nothing other than my immediate vision. At this point I'm lost in my visuals and I'm in the shower feeling fucking great. I see a drop of water on the shower curtain and think, 'what would life be like inside a drop of water?'\n\nI'm out of the shower and decide to play my bass guitar. I put on Rage against the Machine's - Battle of LA. I am really feeling the music AND the the LSD...what a suprise! I'm softly inserting undertones on my bass, and I see the neck and strings all waving, up close, big, out of proportion, completely and utterly awesome! The anxiety is still there, STRONG, I'm trying to enjoy myself but the LSD is so freakin powerful!!!\n\nI start hearing audio hallucinations and at the same time visuals of lights turning on and off, plenty of color. The audio hallucinations sounded like the devil. Voices outside sounded like rumbling thunder. At this point I really need to talk to someone. I call my Mom at work. As soon as I start speaking I sound very loud and unusual, my Mom asks if I'm alright...what am I supposed to say, 'Well I'm on LSD!' No, that's not right.\n\nNow I REALLY need to leave my house or else the anxiety will drive me into a wall! I go outside with the phone and a cigarette. The side of my house looked like it was expanding in the upwards and downwards directions. I get in touch with my friend, who I'll call N, and I go to his house down the street to meet him and another friend A, whom were and are two of my best friends.\n\nWhen I get there I'm talking very loud and I say I think I've eaten some LSD. After a while, it is abundantly clear to them that I have. They stick by me and keep me relaxed. We drive over to a friend's house I'll call E, another best, and he has a friend chillin there. I wasn't feeling too high at this point, but everything on my mind was affecting me.\n\nI call my Mom again to talk, I tell her what happened, and she wants me home immediately. This was something I had to struggle with, I didn't wanna go home I'm out enjoying a high what good would coming home be if i'm going to get in trouble??? I decided to stay out and told my parents I would be safe and home later that evening.\n\nI go have a quality conversation with my friend A. He is a very experienced tripper of LSD and he comforts while we talk about jokes or funny experiences while the other people are out somewhere. They get back and I go for a ride with my friend N, we talk and I tell him how horrible the situation I'm in is, and that I'm in trouble. He ensures me that he is there and will help me.\n\nWe get back to E's house and then another friend shows up, he wants to smoke. Five of us head down the street to another friend's house to smoke. We sit out back and smoke dank bud out of a bubbler. My high starts to come back a little but the plateau had worn off a while ago.\n\nMy thinking goes on auto-pilot. I would think about the ramifications and harmony that come about through conversation. I decided not to speak after my thoughts flew right past the conversation.\n\nI come around after taking a piss and declare that on this day I am fucked up! At this point I feel sober enough to talk. I start to relax and my anxiety goes away. The trip slowed down and I started coming back to baseline.\n\nI decide it would be good to go home around 5 PM. When I go home I see some more visuals, talk with my parents, and make ammends. Almost a year has passed now. Since that summer, in the way of drugs I've decided not to touch cocaine, not to take LSD, ecstacy, heroine, ect...be careful, especially of the big ones...i'm serious\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this and learned a few things...\n\n\nRetrospective:\nFrom my personal experience...\n\nEating LSD at 9 AM: expect a freaking trip (see above) ^^.\nGel Tabs are potent, handle with care. I ate some 2 hits of paper/blotter about 2 months later and it wasn't a quarter as strong.\n\nHave friends & people you love to be with. \n\n","Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 104th Congress, my fellow Americans: Again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy, and once again our democracy has spoken. So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress and congratulating you, Mr. Speaker.\nIf we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994. And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992.\nI must say that in both years we didn't hear America singing, we heard America shouting. And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must say, \"We hear you. We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us. For we are the keepers of a sacred trust, and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era.\"\nOver 200 years ago, our Founders changed the entire course of human history by joining together to create a new country based on a single powerful idea: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, . . . endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, and among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\nIt has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea, the American idea, and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times: to Lincoln and to his Congress to preserve the Union and to end slavery; to Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to restrain the abuses and excesses of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world; to Franklin Roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the Great Depression and to win our country's great struggle against fascism; and to all our Presidents since to fight the cold war. Especially, I recall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with Congresses where the majority was of a different party: to Harry Truman, who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the architecture of the cold war; and to Ronald Reagan, whom we wish well tonight and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against communism was won.\nIn another time of change and challenge, I had the honor to be the first President to be elected in the post-cold-war era, an era marked by the global economy, the information revolution, unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for the American people. I came to this hallowed Chamber 2 years ago on a mission, to restore the American dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world. I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored. In this effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes, and I have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor. But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was 2 years ago. Thank you.\nRecord numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global economy. We are at peace, and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world. We have almost 6 million new jobs since I became President, and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. Our businesses are more productive. And here we have worked to bring the deficit down, to expand trade, to put more police on our streets, to give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities.\nBut the rising tide is not lifting all boats. While our Nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our people are still working harder and harder, for less and less. While our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and competitive, too many of our people still can't be sure of having a job next year or even next month. And far more than our material riches are threatened, things far more precious to us, our children, our families, our values.\nOur civil life is suffering in America today. Citizens are working together less and shouting at each other more. The common bonds of community which have been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed. What are we to do about it?\nMore than 60 years ago, at the dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt told our Nation, \"New conditions impose new requirements on Government and those who conduct Government.\" And from that simple proposition, he shaped the New Deal, which helped to restore our Nation to prosperity and define the relationship between our people and their Government for half a century.\nThat approach worked in its time. But we today, we face a very different time and very different conditions. We are moving from an industrial age built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility. Our Government, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen by many as simply a captive of narrow interests, putting more burdens on our citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead. The values that used to hold us all together seem to be coming apart.\nSo tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of understandings, not just with Government but, even more important, with one another as Americans.\nThat's what I want to talk with you about tonight. I call it the New Covenant. But it's grounded in a very, very old idea, that all Americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their God-given talents and determination can take them and to give something back to their communities and their country in return. Opportunity and responsibility: They go hand in hand. We can't have one without the other. And our national community can't hold together without both.\nOur New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our people to meet the challenges of a new economy, how we can change the way our Government works to fit a different time, and, above all, how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common purpose. We must have dramatic change in our economy, our Government, and ourselves.\nMy fellow Americans, without regard to party, let us rise to the occasion. Let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride. As we embark on this new course, let us put our country first, remembering that regardless of party label, we are all Americans. And let the final test of everything we do be a simple one: Is it good for the American people?\nLet me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not better servants. You made a good start by passing that law which applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector, and I was proud to sign it yesterday. But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work around here. Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors of Washington as were here 20 years ago. The American people look at their Capital, and they see a city where the well-connected and the well-protected can work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left out.\nAs the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still doing business as usual; the gifts, the trips, all the things that people are concerned about haven't stopped. Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices. I know there were other considerations in those votes, but I want to use something that I've heard my Republican friends say from time to time, \"There doesn't have to be a law for everything.\" So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists' perks. Just stop. We don't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the American people that things are really changing. But I also hope you will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill, and I'll sign that, too.\nWe should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what they're spending, what they want. We should also curb the role of big money in elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of PAC's. And as I have said for 3 years, we should work to open the airwaves so that they can be an instrument of democracy, not a weapon of destruction, by giving free TV time to candidates for public office.\nWhen the last Congress killed political reform last year, it was reported in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the Halls of this sacred building and cheered. This year, let's give the folks at home something to cheer about.\nMore important, I think we all agree that we have to change the way the Government works. Let's make it smaller, less costly, and smarter; leaner, not meaner.\nI just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine is alive and well.\nThe New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter. The old way of governing around here protected organized interests. We should look out for the interests of ordinary people. The old way divided us by interest, constituency, or class. The New Covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of what's best for our country. The old way dispensed services through large, top-down, inflexible bureaucracies. The New Covenant way should shift these resources and decisionmaking from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy. The old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure. The New Covenant way should have built-in incentives to reward success. The old way was centralized here in Washington. The New Covenant way must take hold in the communities all across America. And we should help them to do that.\nOur job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy, to empower people to make the most of their own lives, and to enhance our security here at home and abroad. We must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves. We should rely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for each other.\nI hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters, we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is somehow a program for every problem, on the one hand, and the other illusion that the Government is a source of every problem we have. Our job is to get rid of yesterday's Government so that our own people can meet today's and tomorrow's needs. And we ought to do it together.\nYou know, for years before I became President, I heard others say they would cut Government and how bad it was, but not much happened. We actually did it. We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending, more than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions from the Federal bureaucracy in the last 2 years alone. Based on decisions already made, we will have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million positions from the Federal Government, making it the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was President, by the time I come here again next year.\nUnder the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have already saved taxpayers $63 billion. The age of the $500 hammer and the ashtray you can break on \"David Letterman\" is gone. Deadwood programs, like mohair subsidies, are gone. We've streamlined the Agriculture Department by reducing it by more than 1,200 offices. We've slashed the small business loan form from an inch thick to a single page. We've thrown away the Government's 10,000-page personnel manual.\nAnd the Government is working better in important ways: FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has gone from being a disaster to helping people in disasters. You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or the people in California who have dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires, and they'll tell you that. Government workers, working hand in hand with private business, rebuilt southern California's fractured freeways in record time and under budget. And because the Federal Government moved fast, all but one of the 5,600 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business.\nNow, there are a lot of other things that I could talk about. I want to just mention one because it will be discussed here in the next few weeks. University administrators all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable with better repayment terms for students, costs the Government less, and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the Government and for the universities. We shouldn't cap that program. We should give every college in America the opportunity to be a part of it.\nPrevious Government programs gathered dust. The reinventing Government report is getting results. And we're not through. There's going to be a second round of reinventing Government. We propose to cut $130 billion in spending by shrinking departments, extending our freeze on domestic spending, cutting 60 public housing programs down to 3, getting rid of over 100 programs we do not need, like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program. And we're working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more sensible. The programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should go. We have to cut yesterday's Government to help solve tomorrow's problems.\nAnd we need to get Government closer to the people it's meant to serve. We need to help move programs down to the point where States and communities and private citizens in the private sector can do a better job. If they can do it, we ought to let them do it. We should get out of the way and let them do what they can do better. Taking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for.\nIt's time for Congress to stop passing on to the States the cost of decisions we make here in Washington. I know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded mandates legislation, but I want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interests and give justified relief where we need to give it.\nFor years, Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending projects. Last year was no difference. There was a $1 million to study stress in plants and $12 million for a tick removal program that didn't work. It's hard to remove ticks. Those of us who have had them know. But I'll tell you something, if you'll give me line-item veto, I'll remove some of that unnecessary spending.\nBut I think we should all remember, and almost all of us would agree, that Government still has important responsibilities. Our young people—we should think of this when we cut—our young people hold our future in their hands. We still owe a debt to our veterans. And our senior citizens have made us what we are. Now, my budget cuts a lot. But it protects education, veterans, Social Security, and Medicare, and I hope you will do the same thing. You should, and I hope you will.\nAnd when we give more flexibility to the States, let us remember that there are certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every State, North and South, East and West: Immunization against childhood disease, school lunches in all our schools, Head Start, medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants, all these things, all these things are in the national interest.\nI applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations. But when we deregulate, let's remember what national action in the national interest has given us: safer food for our families, safer toys for our children, safer nursing homes for our parents, safer cars and highways, and safer workplaces, cleaner air, and cleaner water. Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations? You bet we do. But we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water. We can have fairness and still clean up toxic dumps, and we ought to do it.\nShould we cut the deficit more? Well, of course we should. Of course we should. But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic recovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished but instead should be helped.\nI know many of you in this Chamber support the balanced budget amendment. I certainly want to balance the budget. Our administration has done more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very, very long time. If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do, then you have to be straight with the American people. They have a right to know what you're going to cut, what taxes you're going to raise, and how it's going to affect them. We should be doing things in the open around here. For example, everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social Security. I would oppose that, and I think most Americans would.\nNothing has done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our failed welfare system. This is one of the problems we have to face here in Washington in our New Covenant. It rewards welfare over work. It undermines family values. It lets millions of parents get away without paying their child support. It keeps a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time.\nI've worked on this problem for a long time, nearly 15 years now. As a Governor, I had the honor of working with the Reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988. In the last 2 years, we made a good start at continuing the work of welfare reform. Our administration gave two dozen States the right to slash through Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency.\nLast year I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by an administration. We have to make welfare what it was meant to be, a second chance, not a way of life. We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible, to provide child care and teach them skills, if that's what they need, for up to 2 years. And after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule: Anyone who can work must go to work. If a parent isn't paying child support, they should be forced to pay. We should suspend drivers' license, track them across State lines, make them work off what they owe. That is what we should do. Governments do not raise children, people do. And the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world.\nI want to work with you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform. But our goal must be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to independence, from welfare to work, from mere childbearing to responsible parenting. Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor.\nWe should, we should require work and mutual responsibility. But we shouldn't cut people off just because they're poor, they're young, or even because they're unmarried. We should promote responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised settings, by requiring them to finish school. But we shouldn't put them and their children out on the street. And I know all the arguments, pro and con, and I have read and thought about this for a long time. I still don't think we can in good conscience punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.\nMy fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the American people care about this without regard to party or race or region. So let this be the year we end welfare as we know it. But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue to divide America. No one is more eager to end welfareI may be the only President who has actually had the opportunity to sit in a welfare office, who's actually spent hours and hours talking to people on welfare. And I am telling you, the people who are trapped on it know it doesn't work; they also want to get off. So we can promote, together, education and work and good parenting. I have no problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent. I just don't want to punish poverty and past mistakes. All of us have made our mistakes, and none of us can change our yesterdays. But every one of us can change our tomorrows. And America's best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey, who worked her way off welfare to become a Congresswoman from the State of California.\nI know the Members of this Congress are concerned about crime, as are all the citizens of our country. And I remind you that last year we passed a very tough crime bill: longer sentences, \"three strikes and you're out,\" almost 60 new capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention, 100,000 more police. And we paid for it all by reducing the size of the Federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower the crime rate.\nThere may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be smarter with crime, to help to lower that rate first. Well, if there are, let's talk about them, and let's do them. But let's not go back on the things that we did last year that we know work, that we know work because the local law enforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing, because local community leaders who have worked for years and years to lower the crime rate tell us that they work. Let's look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it. And if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate—and I am convinced that it does—let us not go back on it. Let's stick with it, implement it. We've got 4 more hard years of work to do to do that.\nI don't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight, but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly last year. The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and, in the crime bill, the ban on 19 assault weapons. I don't think it's a secret to anybody in this room that several Members of the last Congress who voted for that aren't here tonight because they voted for it. And I know, therefore, that some of you who are here because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it. I just have to tell you how I feel about it.\nThe Members of Congress who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activities. I've done it since I was a boy, and I'm going to keep right on doing it until I can't do it anymore. But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of assault weapon attack, and I will not let that be repealed. I will not let it be repealed.\nI'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with. I want us to cut more spending, but I hope we won't cut Government programs that help to prepare us for the new economy, promote responsibility, and are organized from the grassroots up, not by Federal bureaucracy. The very best example of this is the national service corps, AmeriCorps. It passed with strong bipartisan support. And now there are 20,000 Americans, more than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps, working all over this country, helping people person-to-person in local grassroots volunteer groups, solving problems, and in the process earning some money for their education. This is citizenship at its best. It's good for the AmeriCorps members, but it's good for the rest of us, too. It's the essence of the New Covenant, and we shouldn't stop it.\nAll Americans, not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens. In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.\nThe most important job of our Government in this new era is to empower the American people to succeed in the global economy. America has always been a land of opportunity, a land where, if you work hard, you can get ahead. We've become a great middle class country. Middle class values sustain us. We must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass, even as we do everything we can to support the millions of Americans who are already successful in the new economy.\nAmerica is once again the world's strongest economic power: almost 6 million new jobs in the last 2 years, exports booming, inflation down. High-wage jobs are coming back. A record number of American entrepreneurs are living the American dream. If we want it to stay that way, those who work and lift our Nation must have more of its benefits.\nToday, too many of those people are being left out. They're working harder for less. They have less security, less income, less certainty that they can even afford a vacation, much less college for their kids or retirement for themselves. We cannot let this continue. If we don't act, our economy will probably keep doing what it's been doing since about 1978, when the income growth began to go to those at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle got very little growth, and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then fell even further and further behind in the years afterward, no matter how hard they worked.\nWe've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this new economy work for all of our people, a Government that helps each and every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skills. That's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the last 2 years, from Head Start to public schools, to apprenticeships for young people who don't go to college, to making college loans more available and more affordable. That's the first thing we have to do. We've got to do something to empower people to improve their skills.\nThe second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes immediately by lowering their taxes. We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million families with incomes under $27,000, a tax cut that this year will average about $1,000 a family. And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses. Before we could do more than that, we first had to bring down the deficit we inherited, and we had to get economic growth up. Now we've done both. And now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way. But tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation: to empower our citizens through education and training to make the most of their own lives. The spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for themselves, their families, and their communities.\nI have proposed the middle class bill of rights, which should properly be called the bill of rights and responsibilities because its provisions only benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to educate themselves. It will, therefore, give needed tax relief and raise incomes in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefits all of us.\nThere are four provisions. First, a tax deduction for all education and training after high school. If you think about it, we permit businesses to deduct their investment, we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages, but today an education is even more important to the economic well-being of our whole country than even those things are. We should do everything we can to encourage it. And I hope you will support it. Second, we ought to cut taxes $500 for families with children under 13. Third, we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by permitting people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education, health care, first-time homebuying, or the care of a parent. And fourth, we should pass a GI bill for America's workers. We propose to collapse nearly 70 Federal programs and not give the money to the States but give the money directly to the American people, offer vouchers to them so that they, if they're laid off or if they're working for a very low wage, can get a voucher worth $2,600 a year for up to 2 years to go to their local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills they need to improve their lives. Let's empower people in this way, move it from the Government directly to the workers of America.\nNow, any one of us can call for a tax cut, but I won't accept one that explodes the deficit or puts our recovery at risk. We ought to pay for our tax cuts fully and honestly.\nJust 2 years ago, it was an open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit. Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then, many of whom didn't return, we did cut the deficit. We began to do what others said would not be done. We cut the deficit by over $600 billion, about $10,000 for every family in this country. It's coming down 3 years in a row for the first time since Mr. Truman was President, and I don't think anybody in America wants us to let it explode again.\nIn the budget I will send you, the middle class bill of rights is fully paid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy, cuts in programs, cuts in special interest subsidies. And the spending cuts will more than double the tax cuts. My budget pays for the middle class bill of rights without any cuts in Medicare. And I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with Medicare cuts. That's not the right thing to do.\nI know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief, and some of them I find quite interesting. I really want to work with all of you. My test for our proposals will be: Will it create jobs and raise incomes; will it strengthen our families and support our children; is it paid for; will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass? If it does, I'll support it. But if it doesn't, I won't.\nThe goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is also why I believe that you should raise the minimum wage. It rewards work. Two and a half million Americans, two and a half million Americans, often women with children, are working out there today for $4.25 an hour. In terms of real buying power, by next year that minimum wage will be at a 40-year low. That's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work.\nNow, I've studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum wage increase. I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market. But the most important thing is, you can't make a living on $4.25 an hour, especially if you have children, even with the working families tax cut we passed last year. In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue, and I think it should be again. So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on this, to get together, to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage.\nMembers of Congress have been here less than a month, but by the end of the week, 28 days into the new year, every Member of Congress will have earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker makes all year long.\nEverybody else here, including the President, has something else that too many Americans do without, and that's health care. Now, last year we almost came to blows over health care, but we didn't do anything. And the cold, hard fact is that, since last year, since I was here, another 1.1 million Americans in working families have lost their health care. And the cold, hard fact is that many millions more, most of them farmers and small business people and self-employed people, have seen their premiums skyrocket, their copays and deductibles go up. There's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have health insurance but really what they've got is a piece of paper that says they won't lose their home if they get sick.\nNow, I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health security for every American family. But I know that last year, as the evidence indicates, we bit off more than we could chew. So I'm asking you that we work together. Let's do it step by step. Let's do whatever we have to do to get something done. Let's at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage for facing skyrocketing prices, that nobody loses their coverage because they face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or lose a job or a family member gets sick.\nI want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this, with the Democrats who worked on it last time, with the Republican leaders like Senator Dole, who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made some constructive proposals in this area last year. We ought to make sure that self-employed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools. We ought to help families provide long-term care for a sick parent or a disabled child. We can work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work. And we can find a way—it may take some time, but we can find a way—to make sure that our children have health care.\nYou know, I think everybody in this room, without regard to party, can be proud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world's most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade. But we can't be proud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the world that has a smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health insurance today than we did 10 years ago, the last time we were the most productive economy in the world. So let's work together on this. It is too important for politics as usual.\nMuch of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we've already talked about. A lot of people think that the security concerns of America today are entirely internal to our borders. They relate to the security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children, our streets, our health, and protecting those borders. Now that the cold war has passed, it's tempting to believe that all the security issues, with the possible exception of trade, reside here at home. But it's not so. Our security still depends upon our continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy. We still can't be strong at home unless we're strong abroad.\nThe financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point. I know it's not popular to say it tonight, but we have to act, not for the Mexican people but for the sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to Mexico's well-being. If we want to secure American jobs, preserve American exports, safeguard America's borders, then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put Mexico back on track.\nNow let me repeat: It's not a loan; it's not foreign aid; it's not a bailout. We will be given a guarantee like cosigning a note, with good collateral that will cover our risks. This legislation is the right thing for America. That's why the bipartisan leadership has supported it. And I hope you in Congress will pass it quickly. It is in our interest, and we can explain it to the American people because we're going to do it in the right way.\nYou know, tonight, this is the first State of the Union Address ever delivered since the beginning of the cold war when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America. And along with the Russians, we're on our way to destroying the missiles and the bombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads. We've come so far so fast in this post-cold-war world that it's easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for granted. But it's still there, and we aren't finished yet.\nThis year I'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons that carry 5,000 more warheads. The United States will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical weapons. To stop and roll back North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear program, we'll continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation. It's smart. It's tough. It's a deal based on continuing inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves.\nThis year I'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home or abroad. As the cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out, this country will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice.\nJust this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and injured scores more. On behalf of the American people and all of you, I send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in the face of such evil, it is hard for the people in the Middle East to go forward. But the terrorists represent the past, not the future. We must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors in the Middle East.\nAccordingly, last night I signed an Executive order that will block the assets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the peace process. It prohibits financial transactions with these groups. And tonight I call on all our allies and peace-loving nations throughout the world to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism. We cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and paralysis.\nFrom the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our Nation would maintain the best equipped, best trained, and best prepared military on Earth. We have, and they are. They have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit. But to make sure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their families deserve, I'm asking the Congress to add $25 billion in defense spending over the next 6 years.\nI have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became President. Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction. We ask a very great deal of our Armed Forces. Now that they are smaller in number, we ask more of them. They go out more often to more different places and stay longer. They are called to service in many, many ways. And we must give them and their families what the times demand and what they have earned.\nJust think about what our troops have done in the last year, showing America at its best, helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda, moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait, giving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti. We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South Africa to Northern Ireland, from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia, from Latin America to the Middle East. All these endeavors are good in those places, but they make our future more confident and more secure.\nWell, my fellow Americans, that's my agenda for America's future: expanding opportunity, not bureaucracy; enhancing security at home and abroad; empowering our people to make the most of their own lives. It's ambitious and achievable, but it's not enough. We even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping Americans to compete in the new economy, more than a Government that's smaller, smarter, and wiser, more than all of the changes we can make in Government and in the private sector from the outside in.\nOur fortunes and our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer some questions from within, from the values and voices that speak to our hearts as well as our heads; voices that tell us we have to do more to accept responsibility for ourselves and our families, for our communities, and yes, for our fellow citizens. We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart, and we feel the common ground shifting from under us. The PTA, the town hall meeting, the ball park, it's hard for a lot of overworked parents to find the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation. Too many of our children don't even have parents and grandparents who can give them those experiences that they need to build their own character and their sense of identity.\nWe all know what while we here in this Chamber can make a difference on those things, that the real differences will be made by our fellow citizens, where they work and where they live and that it will be made almost without regard to party. When I used to go to the softball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter's league, and people would come up to me, fathers and mothers, and talk to me, I can honestly say I had no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or Democrats. When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California, northern California, last week, a woman came up to me and did something that very few of you would do. She hugged me and said, \"Mr. President, I'm a Republican, but I'm glad you're here.\"\nNow, why? We can't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every day, because as we move into this next century, everybody matters. We don't have a person to waste. And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to do better. That means that we need a New Covenant for everybody.\nFor our corporate and business leaders, we're going to work here to keep bringing the deficit down, to expand markets, to support their success in every possible way. But they have an obligation when they're doing well to keep jobs in our communities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate.\nFor people in the entertainment industry in this country, we applaud your creativity and your worldwide success, and we support your freedom of expression. But you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant, repetitive, mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media all the time.\nWe've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to help us stop our most serious social problem, the epidemic of teen pregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I have sent to Congress a plan to target schools all over this country with antipregnancy programs that work. But Government can only do so much. Tonight I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference. We can do this, and we must.\nAnd I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders. You know, I'm proud of the fact the United States has more houses of worship per capita than any country in the world. These people who lead our houses of worship can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action, can reach out to all of our children, to all of the people in distress, to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear. Because so much of what must be done must come from the inside out and our religious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference, they have a role in the New Covenant as well.\nThere must be more responsibility for all of our citizens. You know, it takes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets and in school. It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity houses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin. It takes a lot of people to provide the people power for all of the civic organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were kids. It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be.\nI know it's hard when you're working harder for less, when you're under great stress to do these things. A lot of our people don't have the time or the emotional stress, they think, to do the work of citizenship.\nMost of us in politics haven't helped very much. For years, we've mostly treated citizens like they were consumers or spectators, sort of political couch potatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads either promise them something for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations. And more and more of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive ways that are hardly conducive to honest and open conversations. But the truth is, we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different views.\nIf you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of America, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago, has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And in this day, everybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply cannot want for a tornado, a fire, or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another.\nI want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the First Lady that represent what I'm trying to talk about—citizens. I have no idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last election. But they represent what we ought to be doing.\nCindy Perry teaches second graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural Kentucky. She gains when she gives. She's a mother of four. She says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency last year. She was married when she was a teenager—stand up, Cindy. She was married when she was a teenager. She had four children. But she had time to serve other people, to get her high school equivalency, and she's going to use her AmeriCorps money to go back to college.\nChief Stephen Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City. He's been a national leader—stand up, Steve. He's been a national leader in using more police in community policing, and he's worked with AmeriCorps to do it. And the crime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he did.\nCorporal Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country's force to help secure democracy in his native land. And I might add, we must be the only country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken Haitian-Americans there who could speak the language and talk to the people. And he was one of them, and we're proud of him.\nThe next two folks I've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a little bit, the Reverend John and the Reverend Diana Cherry of the AME Zion Church in Temple Hills, Maryland. I'd like to ask them to stand. I want to tell you about them. In the early eighties, they left Government service and formed a church in a small living room in a small house, in the early eighties. Today that church has 17,000 members. It is one of the three or four biggest churches in the entire United States. It grows by 200 a month. They do it together. And the special focus of their ministry is keeping families together.\nTwo things they did make a big impression on me. I visited their church once, and I learned they were building a new sanctuary closer to the Washington, DC, line in a higher crime, higher drug rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them. The second thing I want to say is that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House with some other religious leaders, and he left early to go back to this church to minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all over America to convince them to come back together, to save their marriages, and to raise their kids. This is the kind of work that citizens are doing in America. We need more of it, and it ought to be lifted up and supported.\nThe last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Jack, would you stand up? Fifty years ago, in the sands of Iwo Jima, Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship. On February 20th, 1945, he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them. In that moment, he saved the lives of his companions, and miraculously in the next instant, a medic saved his life. He gained a foothold for freedom, and at the age of 17, just a year older than his grandson who is up there with him today—and his son, who is a West Point graduate and a veteran—at 17, Jack Lucas became the youngest Marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor. All these years later, yesterday, here's what he said about that day: \"It didn't matter where you were from or who you were, you relied on one another. You did it for your country.\"\nWe all gain when we give, and we reap what we sow. That's at the heart of this New Covenant. Responsibility, opportunity, and citizenship, more than stale chapters in some remote civic book, they're still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the enduring dream from that first and most sacred covenant. I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our Creator the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This is a very, very great country. And our best days are still to come.\nThank you, and God bless you all.\n","Oceania is a geographic region which includes Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. Spanning the eastern and western hemispheres, Oceania has a land area of 8,525,989 km2 and has a population of million. Situated in the southeast of the Asia-Pacific region, Oceania, when compared to continental regions, is the smallest in land area and the second smallest in population after Antarctica.\n\nDefinitions of Oceania vary; however, the islands at the geographic extremes of Oceania are generally considered to be the Bonin Islands, a politically integral part of Japan; Hawaii, a state of the United States; Clipperton Island, a possession of France; the Juan Fernández Islands, belonging to Chile; and Macquarie Island, belonging to Australia. (The United Nations has its own geopolitical definition of Oceania, but this consists of discrete political entities, and so excludes the Bonin Islands, Hawaii, Clipperton Island, and the Juan Fernández Islands, along with Easter Island.) Oceania has a diverse mix of economies from the highly developed and globally competitive financial markets of Australia and New Zealand, which rank high in quality of life and human development index, to the much less developed economies that belong to countries such as Kiribati and Tuvalu, while also including medium-sized economies of Pacific islands such as Palau, Fiji and Tonga. The largest and most populous country in Oceania is Australia, with Sydney being the largest city of both Oceania and Australia. In the 1950s Indonesia and Philippines were removed from Oceania and added to Asia; this resulted in Oceania as a \"great division\" of the world being replaced by the concept of the continent of Australia. . In some countries (such as Brazil) however, Oceania is still regarded as a continent (Portuguese: continente) in the sense of \"one of the parts of the world\", and the concept of Australia as a continent does not exist.\n\nThe first settlers of Australia, New Guinea, and the large islands just to the east arrived more than 60,000 years ago. Oceania was first explored by Europeans from the 16th century onward. Portuguese navigators, between 1512 and 1526, reached the Tanimbar Islands, some of the Caroline Islands and west Papua New Guinea. On his first voyage in the 18th century, James Cook, who later arrived at the highly developed Hawaiian Islands, went to Tahiti and followed the east coast of Australia for the first time. The Pacific front saw major action during the Second World War, mainly between Allied powers the United States and Australia, and Axis power Japan.\n\nThe arrival of European settlers in subsequent centuries resulted in a significant alteration in the social and political landscape of Oceania. In more contemporary times there has been increasing discussion on national flags and a desire by some Oceanians to display their distinguishable and individualistic identity. The rock art of Australian Aborigines is the longest continuously practiced artistic tradition in the world. Puncak Jaya in Papua is often considered the highest peak in Oceania. Most Oceanian countries have a parliamentary representative democratic multi-party system, with tourism being a large source of income for the Pacific Islands nations.\n\nThe geographer Conrad Malte-Brun coined the French term Océanie c. undefined 1812. Océanie derives from the Latin word, and this from the Greek word (ōkeanós), \"ocean\". The term Oceania is used because, unlike the other continental groupings, it is the ocean that links the parts of the region together.\n * Biogeographically, Oceania serves as a synonym for the Australasian ecozone and the Pacific ecozone (Melanesia, Polynesia, and Micronesia), with New Zealand forming the south-western corner of the Polynesian Triangle. Note that New Zealand may also be considered part of Australasia, despite forming a part of Polynesia.\n * As an ecozone, Oceania includes all of Micronesia, Fiji, and all of Polynesia except New Zealand. New Zealand, along with New Guinea and nearby islands, part of the Philippine islands, Australia, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia, constitute the separate Australasian ecozone.\n * In the geopolitical conception used by the United Nations, by the International Olympic Committee, and by many atlases, Oceania includes Australia and the nations of the Pacific from Papua New Guinea east, but not Indonesian New Guinea.\n\n\n\nIndigenous Australians are the original inhabitants of the Australian continent and nearby islands who migrated from Africa to Asia around 70,000 years ago and arrived in Australia around 50,000 years ago. They are believed to be among the earliest human migrations out of Africa. Although they likely migrated to Australia through Southeast Asia they are not demonstrably related to any known Asian or Polynesian population. There is evidence of genetic and linguistic interchange between Australians in the far north and the Austronesian peoples of modern-day New Guinea and the islands, but this may be the result of recent trade and intermarriage.\n\nThey reached Tasmania approximately 40,000 years ago by migrating across a land bridge from the mainland that existed during the last ice age. It is believed that the first early human migration to Australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the Sahul continent, connected to the island of New Guinea via a land bridge. The Torres Strait Islanders are indigenous to the Torres Strait Islands, which are at the northernmost tip of Queensland near Papua New Guinea. The earliest definite human remains found in Australia are that of Mungo Man, which have been dated at about 40,000 years old.\n\n\n\nThe original inhabitants of the group of islands now named Melanesia were likely the ancestors of the present-day Papuan-speaking people. Migrating from South-East Asia, they appear to have occupied these islands as far east as the main islands in the Solomon Islands archipelago, including Makira and possibly the smaller islands farther to the east.\n\nParticularly along the north coast of New Guinea and in the islands north and east of New Guinea, the Austronesian people, who had migrated into the area somewhat more than 3,000 years ago, came into contact with these pre-existing populations of Papuan-speaking peoples. In the late 20th century, some scholars theorized a long period of interaction, which resulted in many complex changes in genetics, languages, and culture among the peoples.\n\nMicronesia began to be settled several millennia ago, although there are competing theories about the origin and arrival of the first settlers. There are numerous difficulties with conducting archaeological excavations in the islands, due to their size, settlement patterns and storm damage. As a result, much evidence is based on linguistic analysis.\n\nThe earliest archaeological traces of civilization have been found on the island of Saipan, dated to 1500 BC or slightly before. The ancestors of the Micronesians settled there over 4,000 years ago. A decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centered on Yap and Pohnpei. The prehistories of many Micronesian islands such as Yap are not known very well.\n\nThe first people of the Northern Mariana Islands navigated to the islands at some period between 4000 BC to 2000 BC from South-East Asia. They became known as the Chamorros, and spoke an Austronesian language called Chamorro. The ancient Chamorro left a number of megalithic ruins, including Latte stone. The Refaluwasch, or Carolinian, people came to the Marianas in the 1800s from the Caroline Islands. Micronesian colonists gradually settled the Marshall Islands during the 2nd millennium BC, with inter-island navigation made possible using traditional stick charts.\n\nThe Polynesian people are considered to be by linguistic, archaeological and human genetic ancestry a subset of the sea-migrating Austronesian people and tracing Polynesian languages places their prehistoric origins in the Malay Archipelago, and ultimately, in Taiwan. Between about 3000 and 1000 BC speakers of Austronesian languages began spreading from Taiwan into Island South-East Asia, as tribes whose natives were thought to have arrived through South China about 8,000 years ago to the edges of western Micronesia and on into Melanesia.\n\nIn the archaeological record there are well-defined traces of this expansion which allow the path it took to be followed and dated with some certainty. It is thought that by roughly 1400 BC, \"Lapita Peoples\", so-named after their pottery tradition, appeared in the Bismarck Archipelago of north-west Melanesia.\n\nEaster Islanders claimed that a chief Hotu Matu'a arrived on the island in one or two large canoes with his wife and extended family. They are believed to have been Polynesian. Around 1200, Tahitian explorers found and began settling the area. This date range is based on glottochronological calculations and on three radiocarbon dates from charcoal that appears to have been produced during forest clearance activities. Moreover, a recent study which included radiocarbon dates from what is thought to be very early material suggests that the island was settled as recently as 1200.\n\nFrom 1527 to 1595 a number of other large Spanish expeditions crossed the Pacific Ocean, leading to the discovery of the Marshall Islands and Palau in the North Pacific, as well as Tuvalu, the Marquesas, the Solomon Islands archipelago, the Cook Islands and the Admiralty Islands in the South Pacific.\n\nIn the quest for Terra Australis, Spanish explorations in the 17th century, such as the expedition led by the Portuguese navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, discovered the Pitcairn and Vanuatu archipelagos, and sailed the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, named after navigator Luís Vaz de Torres. Willem Janszoon, made the first completely documented European landing in Australia (1606), in Cape York Peninsula. Abel Janszoon Tasman circumnavigated and landed on parts of the Australian continental coast and discovered Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), New Zealand in 1642, and Fiji islands. He was the first known European explorer to reach these islands.\n\nOn 23 April 1770 British explorer James Cook made his first recorded direct observation of indigenous Australians at Brush Island near Bawley Point. On 29 April, Cook and crew made their first landfall on the mainland of the continent at a place now known as the Kurnell Peninsula. It is here that James Cook made first contact with an aboriginal tribe known as the Gweagal. His expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline of Australia.\n\nIn 1789 the Mutiny on the Bounty against William Bligh led to several of the mutineers escaping the Royal Navy and settling on Pitcairn Islands, which later became a British colony. Britain also established colonies in Australia in 1788, New Zealand in 1840 and Fiji in 1872, with much of Oceania becoming part of the British Empire. The Gilbert Islands (now known as Kiribati) and the Ellice Islands (now known as Tuvalu) came under Britain's sphere of influence in the late 19th century.\n\nFrench Catholic missionaries arrived on Tahiti in 1834; their expulsion in 1836 caused France to send a gunboat in 1838. In 1842, Tahiti and Tahuata were declared a French protectorate, to allow Catholic missionaries to work undisturbed. The capital of Papeetē was founded in 1843. On 24 September 1853, under orders from Napoleon III, Admiral Febvrier Despointes took formal possession of New Caledonia and Port-de-France (Nouméa) was founded 25 June 1854.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar landed in the Marshall Islands in 1529. They were named by Krusenstern, after English explorer John Marshall, who visited them together with Thomas Gilbert in 1788, en route from Botany Bay to Canton (two ships of the First Fleet). In 1905 the British government transferred some administrative responsibility over south-east New Guinea to Australia (which renamed the area \"Territory of Papua\"); and in 1906, transferred all remaining responsibility to Australia. The Marshall Islands were claimed by Spain in 1874. Germany established colonies in New Guinea in 1884, and Samoa in 1900. The United States also expanded into the Pacific, beginning with Baker Island and Howland Island in 1857, and with Hawaii becoming a U.S. territory in 1898. Disagreements between the US, Germany and UK over Samoa led to the Tripartite Convention of 1899.\n\nOne of the first land offensives in Oceania was the Occupation of German Samoa in August 1914 by New Zealand forces. The campaign to take Samoa ended without bloodshed after over 1,000 New Zealanders landed on the German colony. Australian forces attacked German New Guinea in September 1914. A company of Australians and a British warship besieged the Germans and their colonial subjects, ending with a German surrender.\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, was a surprise military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on the morning of 7 December 1941. The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II. The Japanese subsequently invaded New Guinea, Solomon Islands and other Pacific islands. The Japanese were turned back at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Kokoda Track campaign before they were finally defeated in 1945. Some of the most prominent Oceanic battlegrounds were the Battle of Bita Paka, the Solomon Islands campaign, the Air raids on Darwin, the Kokada Track, and the Borneo campaign. The United States fought the Battle of Guam from July 21 to August 10, 1944, to recapture the island from Japanese military occupation.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand became dominions in the 20th century, adopting the Statute of Westminster Act in 1942 and 1947 respectively. In 1946, Polynesians were granted French citizenship and the islands' status was changed to an overseas territory; the islands' name was changed in 1957 to Polynésie Française (French Polynesia). Hawaii became a U.S. state in 1959. Fiji and Tonga became independent in 1970. On 1 May 1979, in recognition of the evolving political status of the Marshall Islands, the United States recognized the constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The South Pacific Forum was founded in 1971, which became the Pacific Islands Forum in 2000.\n\nOceania was originally conceived as the lands of the Pacific Ocean, stretching from the Strait of Malacca to the coast of the Americas. It comprised four regions: Polynesia, Micronesia, Malaysia (now called the Malay Archipelago), and Melanesia. Today, parts of three geological continents are included in the term \"Oceania\": Eurasia, Australia, and Zealandia, as well the non-continental volcanic islands of the Philippines, Wallacea, and the open Pacific.\n\nOceania extends to New Guinea in the west, the Bonin Islands in the northwest, the Hawaiian Islands in the northeast, Rapa Nui and Sala y Gómez Island in the east, and Macquarie Island in the south. Not included are the Pacific islands of Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands, the Japanese archipelago, and the Maluku Islands, all on the margins of Asia, and the Aleutian Islands of North America. In its periphery, Oceania sprawls 28 degrees north to the Bonin Islands in the northern hemisphere, and 55 degrees south to Macquarie Island in the southern hemisphere.\n\nOceanian islands are of four basic types: continental islands, high islands, coral reefs and uplifted coral platforms. High islands are of volcanic origin, and many contain active volcanoes. Among these are Bougainville, Hawaii, and Solomon Islands.\n\nOceania is one of eight terrestrial ecozones, which constitute the major ecological regions of the planet. Related to these concepts are Near Oceania, that part of western Island Melanesia which has been inhabited for tens of millennia, and Remote Oceania which is more recently settled. Although the majority of the Oceanian islands lie in the South Pacific, a few of them are not restricted to the Pacific Ocean – Kangaroo Island and Ashmore and Cartier Islands, for instance, are situated in the Southern Ocean and Indian Ocean, respectively, and Tasmania's west coast faces the Southern Ocean. The coral reefs of the South Pacific are low-lying structures that have built up on basaltic lava flows under the ocean's surface. One of the most dramatic is the Great Barrier Reef off northeastern Australia with chains of reef patches. A second island type formed of coral is the uplifted coral platform, which is usually slightly larger than the low coral islands. Examples include Banaba (formerly Ocean Island) and Makatea in the Tuamotu group of French Polynesia.\n\n\n\nMicronesia, which lies north of the equator and west of the International Date Line, includes the Mariana Islands in the northwest, the Caroline Islands in the center, the Marshall Islands to the west and the islands of Kiribati in the southeast.\n\nMelanesia, to the southwest, includes New Guinea, the world's second largest island after Greenland and by far the largest of the Pacific islands. The other main Melanesian groups from north to south are the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands archipelago, Santa Cruz, Vanuatu, Fiji and New Caledonia.\n\nPolynesia, stretching from Hawaii in the north to New Zealand in the south, also encompasses Tuvalu, Tokelau, Samoa, Tonga and the Kermadec Islands to the west, the Cook Islands, Society Islands and Austral Islands in the center, and the Marquesas Islands, Tuamotu, Mangareva Islands, and Easter Island to the east.\n\nAustralasia comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Most of Australasia lies on the southern portion of the Indo-Australian Plate, flanked by the Indian Ocean to the west and the Southern Ocean to the south. The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India.\n\nThe Pacific Plate, which makes up most of Oceania, is an oceanic tectonic plate that lies beneath the Pacific Ocean. At 103 e6km2, it is the largest tectonic plate. The plate contains an interior hot spot forming the Hawaiian Islands. It is almost entirely oceanic crust. The oldest member disappearing by way of the plate tectonics cycle is early-Cretaceous (145 to 137 million years ago).\n\nAustralia, being part of the Indo-Australian plate, is the lowest, flattest, and oldest landmass on Earth and it has had a relatively stable geological history. Geological forces such as tectonic uplift of mountain ranges or clashes between tectonic plates occurred mainly in Australia's early history, when it was still a part of Gondwana. Australia is situated in the middle of the tectonic plate, and therefore currently has no active volcanism. The geology of New Zealand is noted for its volcanic activity, earthquakes and geothermal areas because of its position on the boundary of the Australian Plate and Pacific Plates. Much of the basement rock of New Zealand was once part of the super-continent of Gondwana, along with South America, Africa, Madagascar, India, Antarctica and Australia. The rocks that now form the continent of Zealandia were nestled between Eastern Australia and Western Antarctica.\n\nThe Australia-New Zealand continental fragment of Gondwana split from the rest of Gondwana in the late Cretaceous time (95–90 Ma). By 75 Ma, Zealandia was essentially separate from Australia and Antarctica, although only shallow seas might have separated Zealandia and Australia in the north. The Tasman Sea, and part of Zealandia then locked together with Australia to form the Australian Plate (40 Ma), and a new plate boundary was created between the Australian Plate and Pacific Plate.\n\nMost islands in the Pacific are high islands (volcanic islands), such as, Easter Island, American Samoa and Fiji, among others, having peaks up to 1300 m rising abruptly from the shore. The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands were formed approximately 7 to 30 million years ago, as shield volcanoes over the same volcanic hotspot that formed the Emperor Seamounts to the north and the Main Hawaiian Islands to the south. Hawaii's tallest mountain Mauna Kea is 13796 ft above mean sea level.\n\n\n\nThe most diverse country of Oceania when it comes to the environment is Australia, with tropical rainforests in the north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east, and dry desert in the centre. Desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land. The coastal uplands and a belt of Brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains, while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland. The northernmost point of the east coast is the tropical-rainforested Cape York Peninsula.\n\nProminent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to aridity and fire which include scleromorphy and serotiny. These adaptations are common in species from the large and well-known families Proteaceae (Banksia), Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus – gum trees), and Fabaceae (Acacia – wattle). The flora of Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia is tropical dry forest, with tropical vegetation that includes palm trees, premna protrusa, psydrax odorata, gyrocarpus americanus and derris trifoliata.\n\nNew Zealand's landscape ranges from the fjord-like sounds of the southwest to the tropical beaches of the far north. South Island is dominated by the Southern Alps. There are 18 peaks of more than 3000 metres (9800 ft) in the South Island. All summits over 2,900 m are within the Southern Alps, a chain that forms the backbone of the South Island; the highest peak of which is Aoraki/Mount Cook, at 3754 metre. Earthquakes are common, though usually not severe, averaging 3,000 per year. There is a wide variety of native trees, adapted to all the various micro-climates in New Zealand.\n\nIn Hawaii, one endemic plant, Brighamia, now requires hand-pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct. The two species of Brighamia – B. rockii and B. insignis – are represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants. To ensure these plants set seed, biologists rappel down 3000 foot cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas.\n\nThe aptly-named Pacific kingfisher is found in the Pacific Islands, as is the Red-vented bulbul, Polynesian starling, Brown goshawk, Pacific Swallow and the Cardinal myzomela, among others. Birds breeding on Pitcairn include the fairy tern, common noddy and red-tailed tropicbird. The Pitcairn reed warbler, endemic to Pitcairn Island, was added to the endangered species list in 2008.\n\nNative to Hawaii is the Hawaiian crow, which has been extinct in the wild since 2002. The brown tree snake is native to northern and eastern coasts of Australia, Papua New Guinea, Guam and Solomon Islands. Native to Australia, New Guinea and proximate islands are birds of paradise, honeyeaters, Australasian treecreeper, Australasian robin, kingfishers, butcherbirds and bowerbirds.\n\nA unique feature of Australia's fauna is the relative scarcity of native placental mammals, and dominance of the marsupials – a group of mammals that raise their young in a pouch, including the macropods, possums and dasyuromorphs. The passerines of Australia, also known as songbirds or perching birds, include wrens, the magpie group, thornbills, corvids, pardalotes, lyrebirds. Predominant bird species in the country include the Australian magpie, Australian raven, the pied currawong, crested pigeons and the laughing kookaburra. The koala, emu, platypus and kangaroo are national animals of Australia, and the Tasmanian devil is also one of the well-known animals in the country. The goanna is a predatory lizard native to the Australian mainland.\n\nThe birds of New Zealand evolved into an avifauna that included a large number of endemic species. As an island archipelago New Zealand accumulated bird diversity and when Captain James Cook arrived in the 1770s he noted that the bird song was deafening. The mix includes species with unusual biology such as the kakapo which is the world's only flightless, nocturnal, lek breeding parrot, but also many species that are similar to neighboring land areas. Some of the more well known and distinctive bird species in New Zealand are the kiwi, kea, takahe, kakapo, mohua, tui and the bellbird. The tuatara is a notable reptile endemic to New Zealand.\n\nThe Pacific Islands are ruled by a tropical rainforest and tropical savanna climate. In the tropical and subtropical Pacific, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects weather conditions. In the tropical western Pacific, the monsoon and the related wet season during the summer months contrast with dry winds in the winter which blow over the ocean from the Asian landmass. November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are active.\n\nTo the southwest of the region, in the Australian landmass, the climate is mostly desert or semi-arid, with the southern coastal corners having a temperate climate, such as oceanic and humid subtropical climate in the east coast and Mediterranean climate in the west. The northern parts of the country have a tropical climate. Snow falls frequently on the highlands near the east coast, in the states of Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and in the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nMost regions of New Zealand belong to the temperate zone with a maritime climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb) characterised by four distinct seasons. Conditions vary from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to almost semi-arid in Central Otago and subtropical in Northland. Snow falls in New Zealand's South Island and at higher altitudes in the North Island. It is extremely rare at sea level in the North Island.\n\nHawaii, although being in the tropics, experiences many different climates, depending on latitude and its geography. The island of Hawaii for example hosts 4 (out of 5 in total) climate groups on a surface as small as 4,028 sqmi according to the Köppen climate types: tropical, arid, temperate and polar. The Hawaiian Islands receive most of their precipitation during the winter months (October to April). A few islands in the northwest, such as Guam, are susceptible to typhoons in the wet season.\n\nThe highest recorded temperature in Oceania occurred in Oodnadatta, South Australia (2 January 1960), where the temperature reached 50.7 C. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Oceania was -25.6 C, at Ranfurly in Otago in 1903, with a more recent temperature of -21.6 C recorded in 1995 in nearby Ophir. Pohnpei of the Senyavin Islands in Micronesia is the wettest settlement in Oceania, and one of the wettest places on earth, with annual recorded rainfall exceeding 300 in each year in certain mountainous locations. The Big Bog on the island of Maui is the wettest place, receiving an average 10,271 mm each year.\n\nThe linked map below shows the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the islands of Oceania and neighbouring areas, as a guide to the following table (there are no political boundaries that can be drawn on a map of the Pacific at this scale). The demographic table below shows the subregions and countries of geopolitical Oceania. The countries and territories in this table are categorised according to the scheme for geographic subregions used by the United Nations. The information shown follows sources in cross-referenced articles; where sources differ, provisos have been clearly indicated. These territories and regions are subject to various additional categorisations, depending on the source and purpose of each description.\n\n\n\nThe predominant religion in Oceania is Christianity (73%). A 2011 survey found that 92% in Melanesia, 93% in Micronesia and 96% in Polynesia described themselves as Christians. Traditional religions are often animist, and prevalent among traditional tribes is the belief in spirits (masalai in Tok Pisin) representing natural forces. In the 2013 census, 48% of New Zealanders affiliated themselves with Christianity and 42% declared no religion. In the 2016 Census, 52% of the Australian population declared some variety of Christianity and 30% stated \"no religion\".\n\nIn recent Australian and New Zealand censuses, large proportions of the population say they belong to \"no religion\" (which includes atheism, agnosticism, deism, secular humanism, and rationalism). In Tonga, everyday life is heavily influenced by Polynesian traditions and especially by the Christian faith. The Ahmadiyya mosque in Marshall Islands is the only mosque in Micronesia. Another one in Tuvalu belongs to the same sect. The Bahá'í House of Worship in Tiapapata, Samoa, is one of seven designations administered in the Bahá'í Faith.\n\nOther religions in the region include Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism, which are prominent minority religions in Australia and New Zealand. Judaism, Sikhism and Jainism are also present. Sir Isaac Isaacs was the first Australian born Governor General of Australia and was the first Jewish vice-regal representative in the British Empire. Prince Philip Movement is followed around Yaohnanen village on the southern island of Tanna in Vanuatu.\n\nNative languages of Oceania fall into three major geographic groups:\n * The large Austronesian language family, with such languages as Malay (Indonesian), and Polynesian languages such as Maori and Hawaiian\n * The Aboriginal Australian languages, including the large Pama–Nyungan family\n * The Papuan languages of New Guinea and neighbouring islands, including the large Trans–New Guinea family\n\nColonial languages include English in Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and many other territories; French in New Caledonia and French Polynesia, Japanese in the Bonin Islands, Spanish on Easter Island. There are also Creoles formed from the interaction of Malay or the colonial languages with indigenous languages, such as Tok Pisin, Bislama, Chavacano, various Malay trade and creole languages, Hawaiian Pidgin, Norfuk, and Pitkern. Contact between Austronesian and Papuan resulted in several instances in mixed languages such as Maisin.\n\nImmigrants brought their own languages to the region, such as Mandarin, Italian, Arabic, Polish, Hindi, German, Spanish, Korean, Cantonese and Greek, among others, namely in Australia and New Zealand, or Fiji Hindi in Fiji.\n\nThe most multicultural areas in Oceania, which have a high degree of immigration, are Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. Since 1945, more than 7 million people have settled in Australia. From the late 1970s, there was a significant increase in immigration from Asian and other non-European countries, making Australia a multicultural country.\n\nSydney is the most multicultural city in Oceania, having more than 250 different languages spoken with about 40 percent of residents speaking a language other than English at home. Furthermore, 36 percent of the population reported having been born overseas, with top countries being Italy, Lebanon, Vietnam and Iraq, among others. Melbourne is also fairly multicultural, having the largest Greek-speaking population outside of Europe, and the second largest Asian population in Australia after Sydney.\n\nEuropean migration to New Zealand provided a major influx following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Subsequent immigration has been chiefly from the British Isles, but also from continental Europe, the Pacific, The Americas and Asia. Auckland is home to over half (51.6 percent) of New Zealand's overseas born population, including 72 percent of the country's Pacific Island-born population, 64 percent of its Asian-born population, and 56 percent of its Middle Eastern and African born population. Hawaii is a majority-minority state. Chinese workers on Western trading ships settled in Hawaii starting in 1789. In 1820, the first American missionaries arrived to preach Christianity and teach the Hawaiians Western ways. , a large proportion of Hawaii's population have Asian ancestry – especially Filipino, Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Many are descendants of immigrants brought to work on the sugarcane plantations in the mid-to-late 19th century. Almost 13,000 Portuguese immigrants had arrived by 1899; they also worked on the sugarcane plantations. Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began in 1899 when Puerto Rico's sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes, causing a worldwide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for sugar from Hawaii.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2007 Australia's Pacific Solution policy transferred asylum seekers to several Pacific nations, including the Nauru detention centre. Australia, New Zealand and other nations took part in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands between 2003 and 2017 after a request for aid.\n\nArchaeology, linguistics, and existing genetic studies indicate that Oceania was settled by two major waves of migration. The first migration took place approximately 40 thousand years ago, and these migrants, Papuans, colonised much of Near Oceania. Approximately 3.5 thousand years ago, a second expansion of Austronesian speakers arrived in Near Oceania, and the descendants of these people spread to the far corners of the Pacific, colonising Remote Oceania.\n\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies quantify the magnitude of the Austronesian expansion and demonstrate the homogenising effect of this expansion. With regards to Papuan influence, autochthonous haplogroups support the hypothesis of a long history in Near Oceania, with some lineages suggesting a time depth of 60 thousand years. Santa Cruz, a population located in Remote Oceania, is an anomaly with extreme frequencies of autochthonous haplogroups of Near Oceanian origin.\n\nLarge areas of New Guinea are unexplored by scientists and anthropologists due to extensive forestation and mountainous terrain. Known indigenous tribes in Papua New Guinea have very little contact with local authorities aside from the authorities knowing who they are. Many remain preliterate and, at the national or international level, the names of tribes and information about them is extremely hard to obtain. The Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua on the island of New Guinea are home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.\n\n\n\nAustralia and New Zealand are the only developed nations in the region, although the economy of Australia is by far the largest and most dominant economy in the region and one of the largest in the world. Australia's per-capita GDP is higher than that of the UK, Canada, Germany, and France in terms of purchasing power parity. New Zealand is also one of the most globalised economies and depends greatly on international trade.\n\nThe Australian Securities Exchange in Sydney is the largest stock exchange in Australia and in the South Pacific. New Zealand is the 53rd-largest national economy in the world measured by nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and 68th-largest in the world measured by purchasing power parity (PPP). In 2012, Australia was the 12th largest national economy by nominal GDP and the 19th-largest measured by PPP-adjusted GDP.\n\nMercer Quality of Living Survey ranks Sydney tenth in the world in terms of quality of living, making it one of the most livable cities. It is classified as an Alpha+ World City by GaWC. Melbourne also ranked highly in the world's most liveable city list, and is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region. Auckland and Wellington, in New Zealand, are frequently ranked among the world's most liveable cities with Auckland being ranked 3rd according to the Mercer Quality of Living Survey.\n\nThe majority of people living in Australia and to a lesser extent, New Zealand work in mining, electrical and manufacturing sectors also. Australia boasts the largest amount of manufacturing in the region, producing cars, electrical equipment, machinery and clothes.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of people living in the Pacific islands work in the service industry which includes tourism, education and financial services. Oceania's largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States and South Korea. The smallest Pacific nations rely on trade with Australia, New Zealand and the United States for exporting goods and for accessing other products. Australia and New Zealand's trading arrangements are known as Closer Economic Relations. Australia and New Zealand, along with other countries, are members of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the East Asia Summit (EAS), which may become trade blocs in the future particularly EAS.\n\nThe main produce from the Pacific is copra or coconut, but timber, beef, palm oil, cocoa, sugar and ginger are also commonly grown across the tropics of the Pacific. Fishing provides a major industry for many of the smaller nations in the Pacific, although many fishing areas are exploited by other larger countries, namely Japan. Natural Resources, such as lead, zinc, nickel and gold, are mined in Australia and Solomon Islands. Oceania's largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States, India, South Korea and the European Union.\n\nEndowed with forest, mineral, and fish resources, Fiji is one of the most developed of the Pacific island economies, though it remains a developing country with a large subsistence agriculture sector. Agriculture accounts for 18% of gross domestic product, although it employed some 70% of the workforce as of 2001. Sugar exports and the growing tourist industry are the major sources of foreign exchange. Sugar cane processing makes up one-third of industrial activity. Coconuts, ginger, and copra are also significant.\n\nThe history of Hawaii's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries; sandalwood, whaling, sugarcane, pineapple, the military, tourism and education. Hawaiian exports include food and clothing. These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy, due to the shipping distance to viable markets, such as the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. The state's food exports include coffee, macadamia nuts, pineapple, livestock, sugarcane and honey. , Honolulu was ranked high on world livability rankings, and was also ranked as the 2nd safest city in the U.S.\n\nTourists mostly come from Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Fiji currently draws almost half a million tourists each year; more than a quarter from Australia. This contributes $1 billion or more since 1995 to Fiji's economy but the Government of Fiji islands underestimate these figures due to invisible economy inside tourism industry.\n\nVanuatu is widely recognised as one of the premier vacation destinations for scuba divers wishing to explore coral reefs of the South Pacific region. Tourism has been promoted, in part, by Vanuatu being the site of several reality-TV shows. The ninth season of the reality TV series Survivor was filmed on Vanuatu, entitled Survivor: Vanuatu – Islands of Fire. Two years later, Australia's Celebrity Survivor was filmed at the same location used by the US version.\n\nTourism in Australia is an important component of the Australian economy. In the financial year 2014/15, tourism represented 3% of Australia's GDP contributing A$47.5 billion to the national economy. In 2015, there were 7.4 million visitor arrivals. Popular Australian destinations include the Sydney Harbour (Sydney Opera House, Sydney Harbour Bridge, Royal Botanic Garden, etc.), Gold Coast (theme parks such as Warner Bros. Movie World, Dreamworld and Sea World), Walls of Jerusalem National Park and Mount Field National Park in Tasmania, Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne, the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, The Twelve Apostles in Victoria, Uluru (Ayers Rock) and the Australian outback.\n\nTourism in New Zealand contributes NZ$7.3 billion (or 4%) of the country's GDP in 2013, as well as directly supporting 110,800 full-time equivalent jobs (nearly 6% of New Zealand's workforce). International tourist spending accounted for 16% of New Zealand's export earnings (nearly NZ$10 billion). International and domestic tourism contributes, in total, NZ$24 billion to New Zealand's economy every year. Tourism New Zealand, the country's official tourism agency, is actively promoting the country as a destination worldwide. Milford Sound in South Island is acclaimed as New Zealand's most famous tourist destination.\n\nIn 2003 alone, according to state government data, there were over 6.4 million visitors to the Hawaiian Islands with expenditures of over $10.6 billion. Due to the mild year-round weather, tourist travel is popular throughout the year. In 2011, Hawaii saw increasing arrivals and share of foreign tourists from Canada, Australia and China increasing 13%, 24% and 21% respectively from 2010.\n\n\n\nAustralia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth II at its apex as the Queen of Australia, a role that is distinct from her position as monarch of the other Commonwealth realms. The Queen is represented in Australia by the Governor-General at the federal level and by the Governors at the state level, who by convention act on the advice of her ministers. There are two major political groups that usually form government, federally and in the states: the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition which is a formal grouping of the Liberal Party and its minor partner, the National Party. Within Australian political culture, the Coalition is considered centre-right and the Labor Party is considered centre-left. The Australian Defence Force is by far the largest military force in Oceania.\n\nNew Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its constitution is not codified. Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand and the head of state. The Queen is represented by the Governor-General, whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister. The New Zealand Parliament holds legislative power and consists of the Queen and the House of Representatives. A parliamentary general election must be called no later than three years after the previous election. New Zealand is identified as one of the world's most stable and well-governed states, with high government transparency and among the lowest perceived levels of corruption.\n\nIn Samoan politics, the Prime Minister of Samoa is the head of government. The 1960 constitution, which formally came into force with independence from New Zealand in 1962, builds on the British pattern of parliamentary democracy, modified to take account of Samoan customs. The national government (malo) generally controls the legislative assembly. Politics of Tonga takes place in a framework of a constitutional monarchy, whereby the King is the Head of State.\n\nFiji has a multiparty system with the Prime Minister of Fiji as head of government. The executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Parliament of Fiji. Fiji's Head of State is the President. He is elected by Parliament of Fiji after nomination by the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition, for a three-year term.\n\nIn the politics of Papua New Guinea the Prime Minister is the head of government. In Kiribati, the President of Kiribati is the head of government, and of a multi-party system.\n\nNew Caledonia remains an integral part of the French Republic. Inhabitants of New Caledonia are French citizens and carry French passports. They take part in the legislative and presidential French elections. New Caledonia sends two representatives to the French National Assembly and two senators to the French Senate.\n\nHawaii is dominated by the Democratic Party. As codified in the Constitution of Hawaii, there are three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial. The governor is elected statewide. The lieutenant governor acts as the Secretary of State. The governor and lieutenant governor oversee twenty agencies and departments from offices in the State Capitol.\n\n\n\nSince 1788, the primary influence behind Australian culture has been Anglo-Celtic Western culture, with some Indigenous influences. The divergence and evolution that has occurred in the ensuing centuries has resulted in a distinctive Australian culture. Since the mid-20th century, American popular culture has strongly influenced Australia, particularly through television and cinema. Other cultural influences come from neighbouring Asian countries, and through large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking nations. The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature length film, spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era. The Australian Museum in Sydney and the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne are the oldest and largest museums in Oceania. The city's New Year's Eve celebrations are the largest in Oceania.\n\nAustralia is also known for its cafe and coffee culture in urban centres. Australia and New Zealand were responsible for the flat white coffee. Most Indigenous Australian tribal groups subsisted on a simple hunter-gatherer diet of native fauna and flora, otherwise called bush tucker. The first settlers introduced British food to the continent, much of which is now considered typical Australian food, such as the Sunday roast. Multicultural immigration transformed Australian cuisine; post-World War II European migrants, particularly from the Mediterranean, helped to build a thriving Australian coffee culture, and the influence of Asian cultures has led to Australian variants of their staple foods, such as the Chinese-inspired dim sim and Chiko Roll.\n\nThe music of Hawaii includes traditional and popular styles, ranging from native Hawaiian folk music to modern rock and hip hop. Hawaii's musical contributions to the music of the United States are out of proportion to the state's small size. Styles such as slack-key guitar are well known worldwide, while Hawaiian-tinged music is a frequent part of Hollywood soundtracks. Hawaii also made a major contribution to country music with the introduction of the steel guitar. The Hawaiian religion is polytheistic and animistic, with a belief in many deities and spirits, including the belief that spirits are found in non-human beings and objects such as animals, the waves, and the sky.\n\nThe cuisine of Hawaii is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands, including the earliest Polynesians and Native Hawaiian cuisine, and American, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Polynesian and Portuguese origins. Native Hawaiian musician and Hawaiian sovereignty activist Israel Kamakawiwoʻole, famous for his medley of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World\", was named \"The Voice of Hawaii\" by NPR in 2010 in its 50 great voices series.\n\nNew Zealand as a culture is a Western culture, which is influenced by the cultural input of the indigenous Māori and the various waves of multi-ethnic migration which followed the British colonisation of New Zealand. Māori people constitute one of the major cultures of Polynesia. The country has been broadened by globalisation and immigration from the Pacific Islands, East Asia and South Asia. New Zealand marks two national days of remembrance, Waitangi Day and ANZAC Day, and also celebrates holidays during or close to the anniversaries of the founding dates of each province.\n\nThe New Zealand recording industry began to develop from 1940 onwards and many New Zealand musicians have obtained success in Britain and the United States. Some artists release Māori language songs and the Māori tradition-based art of kapa haka (song and dance) has made a resurgence. The country's diverse scenery and compact size, plus government incentives, have encouraged some producers to film big budget movies in New Zealand, including Avatar, The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, The Chronicles of Narnia, King Kong and The Last Samurai.\n\nThe national cuisine has been described as Pacific Rim, incorporating the native Māori cuisine and diverse culinary traditions introduced by settlers and immigrants from Europe, Polynesia and Asia. New Zealand yields produce from land and sea – most crops and livestock, such as maize, potatoes and pigs, were gradually introduced by the early European settlers. Distinctive ingredients or dishes include lamb, salmon, koura (crayfish), dredge oysters, whitebait, paua (abalone), mussels, scallops, pipi and tuatua (both are types of New Zealand shellfish), kumara (sweet potato), kiwifruit, tamarillo and pavlova (considered a national dish).\n\n\n\nThe fa'a Samoa, or traditional Samoan way, remains a strong force in Samoan life and politics. Despite centuries of European influence, Samoa maintains its historical customs, social and political systems, and language. Cultural customs such as the Samoa 'ava ceremony are significant and solemn rituals at important occasions including the bestowal of matai chiefly titles. Items of great cultural value include the finely woven 'ie toga.\n\nThe Samoan word for dance is siva with unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and which tell a story, although the Samoan male dances can be more snappy. The sasa is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid synchronised movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums (pate) or rolled mats. Another dance performed by males is called the fa'ataupati or the slap dance, creating rhythmic sounds by slapping different parts of the body. As with other Polynesian cultures (Hawaiian, Tahitian and Māori) with significant and unique tattoos, Samoans have two gender specific and culturally significant tattoos.\n\nThe artistic creations of native Oceanians varies greatly throughout the cultures and regions. The subject matter typically carries themes of fertility or the supernatural. Petroglyphs, Tattooing, painting, wood carving, stone carving and textile work are other common art forms. Art of Oceania properly encompasses the artistic traditions of the people indigenous to Australia and the Pacific Islands. These early peoples lacked a writing system, and made works on perishable materials, so few records of them exist from this time.\n\nIndigenous Australian rock art is the oldest and richest unbroken tradition of art in the world, dating as far back as 60,000 years and spread across hundreds of thousands of sites. These rock paintings served several functions. Some were used in magic, others to increase animal populations for hunting, while some were simply for amusement. Sculpture in Oceania first appears on New Guinea as a series of stone figures found throughout the island, but mostly in mountainous highlands. Establishing a chronological timeframe for these pieces in most cases is difficult, but one has been dated to 1500 BC.\n\nBy 1500 BC the Lapita culture, descendants of the second wave, would begin to expand and spread into the more remote islands. At around the same time, art began to appear in New Guinea, including the earliest examples of sculpture in Oceania. Starting around 1100 AD, the people of Easter Island would begin construction of nearly 900 moai (large stone statues). At about 1200 AD, the people of Pohnpei, a Micronesian island, would embark on another megalithic construction, building Nan Madol, a city of artificial islands and a system of canals. Hawaiian art includes wood carvings, feather work, petroglyphs, bark cloth (called kapa in Hawaiian and tapa elsewhere in the Pacific) and tattoos. Native Hawaiians had neither metal nor woven cloth.\n\nRugby union is one of the region's most prominent sports, and is the national sport of New Zealand, Samoa, Fiji and Tonga. The most popular sport in Australia is cricket, the most popular sport among Australian women is netball, while Australian rules football is the most popular sport in terms of spectatorship and television ratings. Rugby is the most popular sport among New Zealanders. In Papua New Guinea, the most popular sport is Rugby league.\n\nAustralian rules football is the national sport in Nauru and is the most popular football code in Australia in terms of attendance. It has a large following in Papua New Guinea, where it is the second most popular sport after Rugby League. It attracts significant attention across New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. Fiji's sevens team is one of the most successful in the world, as is New Zealand's.\n\nCurrently Vanuatu is the only country in Oceania to call association football its national sport. However, it is also the most popular sport in Kiribati, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, and has a significant (and growing) popularity in Australia. In 2006 Australia joined the Asian Football Confederation and qualified for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups as an Asian entrant.\n\nAustralia has hosted two Summer Olympics: Melbourne 1956 and Sydney 2000. Also, Australia has hosted five editions of the Commonwealth Games (Sydney 1938, Perth 1962, Brisbane 1982, Melbourne 2006, Gold Coast 2018). Meanwhile, New Zealand has hosted the Commonwealth Games three times: Auckland 1950, Christchurch 1974 and Auckland 1990. The Pacific Games (formerly known as the South Pacific Games) is a multi-sport event, much like the Olympics on a much smaller scale, with participation exclusively from countries around the Pacific. It is held every four years and began in 1963. Australia and New Zealand competed in the games for the first time in 2015.\n\n\n","Hey bra, how we doin' man?\nAll right.\nIt's been a while man, life's so rad!\nThis band's my favorite man, don't ya love 'em?\nYeah.\nAw man, you want a beer?\nAll right.\nAw man, this is the best.

I've also done salvia 3 times, with very positive results, and mushrooms twice, also with very positive results, which made me get more interested in trying more drugs, such as acid and MDMA.\n\nMy roommate had mentioned earlier in the week that he was going to a rave this weekend, so I asked if he was rolling. When he said that he was, I asked if I could get in on that and he was very excited to include me in his rave group, which would now be 7 people, including both of us, with only one other person I knew. I had never been to a rave before and had never done ecstasy before, so I was both excited and nervous about the experience.\n\nI smoked almost two hours before we left, so I was still a little high when we piled into the car to drive to the rave. I was sitting in the trunk of an SUV with my roommate and the driver was driving (I thought) really fast and recklessly. This was starting to scare me, as I thought about how I wasn't wearing a seat belt because I was in the very back of the suv, about how we had drugs on us if we were pulled over for speeding (which he was) and about the fact that I was going to do a drug that I had never tried before and that could potentially have some negative effects.\n\nWe got to the warehouse that was hosting the rave and parked and all 7 of us took our first pill. This was at approximately 8:45 pm. My roommate and his friends already had their tickets to the rave so they found the presale line and entered, with my roommate telling me to call him once I got in. I found the line I needed, for people without tickets, which was extremely long and settled in to wait.\n\nAs the line moved slowly and I got closer to the entrance, (T + 0:30), I started getting more and more anxiety. There were cops driving by and occasionally shining lights in our direction, lots of noise and people running around, and it was a pretty sketchy looking area. They say setting is everything with drugs and at this moment, I wasn't comfortable alone where I was, I was worried about the effects of the drug and was pretty much convinced I would have a bad experience. I remember specifically thinking that I was stupid for doing this at night in a setting I didn't know, and regretting not doing this during the day, in my room where I would feel comfortable. I also noticed that I was swaying back and forth in line pretty consistently, and I started wondering if this was the ex setting in or if it was normal for me to sway back and forth while standing in one place for a long time.\n\nI finally got into the rave's outside area (there were 3 stages, one outside, a larger one inside, and another one on the other side of the inside stage) at T: + 0:45 and started to walk towards where my roommate told me to meet him. At this point, I noticed the first concrete effects of the dose starting to kick in: walking felt very weird, as though I could feel the air that I was moving through. There was almost a slight resistance to the air around me, like being underwater but subtler. It was not dissimilar to being high. I filed this away for later and met up with my roommate and his friends. We were sitting on the ground near the front outside stage, close enough to feel some vibrations from the subwoofers. I could not honestly tell you what kind of music was playing, but I think it's safe to say it was electronic or dance of some kind. It was danceable, that's all that's important.\n\nWe sat there for about 20 minutes relatively quietly as we slowly started to feel the effects of the initial dose (T+1:00). Someone, maybe me, maybe someone else, said something along the lines of 'I feel really good,' to which the rest of us all said, in unison 'Yeahhhhhh'. This continued for about 5 minutes, as each of us realized how GOOD we were all feeling. It was an incredible body high, the initial onset of the 'Ecstasy' that gives the drug its name: we just all felt so GOOD! Someone eventually had the bright idea to go dance to the music, which sounded like a really great idea at the time, and we moved to the dance floor.\n\nI'm not much of a dancer; I'm really too tall and awkward and uncoordinated to be a good dancer under normal or even alcohol-related conditions. But as we joined the growing number of people dancing in front of the outside stage, I didn't feel awkward or uncoordinated. All I felt was that growing body high and growing feeling of GOOD that was being fed and amplified by the music. And the MUSIC! Good god, this was IT! This was EXACTLY what I wanted to listen to right now! And the BASS! Wow!\n\nI probably said a lot of this out loud to my friends, who nodded and smiled and agreed with me. I was doing my usual nodding and swaying, which is typically as much dancing as I feel comfortable doing in public, and quickly progressing past it. I was really getting into this music and this dancing, and a quick look around assured me that everyone else was too and no one was even thinking about mocking my 'poor' dancing. I abandoned all self-consciousness about dancing from this point forward.\n\nAfter what seemed like a couple minutes, someone tapped me on the shoulder. It was Ashley, one of the girls in our group, the one besides my roommate that I knew before tonight. She motioned me to follow her out of the dance-area. Apparently, our group was taking a break. I was incredulous. We had just started dancing! And I was feeling so GOOD about dancing! Why would anyone want to stop dancing, even for a minute? And only minutes after we had started? Someone told me that it had been like 45 minutes. Oh. (T+1:45).\n\nI sat for maybe 5 minutes, bobbing my head and swaying to the music, which was getting pretty unfreakingbelievable, and then I heard a familiar noise. It was the opening sounds to 'Warp 1.9' by the Bloody Beetroots (the song that goes 'One! Two! Woop! Woop!' and then gets really heavy), which I absolutely love, especially when high. I immediately knew that this song would wreck me in my current state, and I HAD to dance to it. I informed the group that I was going to go dance some more and Ashley immediately grinned and stood up to follow me. She was right on my level (I got the sense that maybe a couple of the others were having some issues adjusting to the come-up process and the rolling itself, but I wasn't and I wanted to dance).\n\nThe song wrecked me. I lost my shit. I danced like I had never danced before. I texted my two closest friends that had rolled before (V and C), and told them what was up (the song and that I was rolling in general; V in particular had pushed me to try E and loved this song). I felt a sudden connection to them, because they had been exactly where I was now before and I understood where they were when they rolled. It's hard to put into words, but anyone who has rolled before will understand what I mean: when you're rolling, you want to ask people if they're rolling so that you can smile at them and they can smile back, because you are both in the same place and you both completely understand how the other feels at this moment. It's incredible.\n\nAt this point, I lose track of chronological order of things. I remember bits and pieces, but mostly I remember dancing. According to a text I sent to C, I took my second dose at around 10:45, which would be T+2:00, but time was a pretty fickle thing that night. I was still not at the peak of the first dose when I took the second (which I think is a good point to take another if you plan to, because then the peak of the first masks and hastens the come-up of the second) and I was feeling amazing at that point. I could have done anything. I loved everyone there. I could have hugged the world. It wasn't a sense of 'ecstasy' or straight up happiness like the name might imply; I wasn't quite euphoric or giddy with happiness (although that was a part of it and I was pretty happy). I just felt as good as I've ever felt in my life, physically, mentally and everything else. And I wanted to dance.\n\nI remember someone twirling glow sticks in someone's face, as the glow stick-ee watched in amazement. I stood next to them, watching the colors spiral and jump around and run in and out of one another. It was mind-blowing. He finished with them and started spinning in my face. I could have watched the light show for hours. He eventually moved on to someone else and I thanked him profusely.\n\nI remember moving inside to the big stage, which was crowded with people, all rolling, all dancing, all my new best friends. I instantly loved everyone there. I met a guy named 'Hoopy' and we instantly bonded over our shared rolling. We were exactly on each other's level. We exchanged names and phone numbers, because we already knew that we were friends.\n\nI went back and forth between the front outside stage and the main stage inside for a while, texting people while I walked. I told people that I loved them. I saw people wearing soft, fuzzy hats and I walked up to them and rubbed their hats. They smiled and stopped moving so that I could rub their hat for a few seconds until I smiled, hugged them, thanked them and moved on. One person's hat had fuzzy strings with a fuzzy poofball attached at the end hanging from the hat. I started to rub his hat and he took the fuzzy poofballs and rubbed my face and closed eyelids with them. It was mindblowing, the softest things I had ever felt.\n\nThere was some intensely dirty dubstep playing outside. I joined a circle of people going crazy near the stage. Every time a beat dropped, the circle would drop in unison, moving up and down to the slow, thunderous beat.\n\nI remember moving back inside for what I think was a large portion of the night. I took my shirt off and tucked it into my shorts at some point, because it was getting sweaty and the fans that were blowing felt amazing on my bare skin. I'm not a shirtless kind of guy in public, I normally think that guys who walk around shirtless in public look like douches, but that night, I knew that no one would judge me and that I wouldn't judge myself. This was a night for being free and abandoning everything to dance. Why wouldn't I be shirtless?\n\nI remember someone giving me a backrub. It was amazing enough for me to stop dancing for several minutes. I remember more glowsticks being twirled in my face. Someone had thrown really big balloon-like things into the crowd that would vibrate intensely with the beat. I pressed one against my face and felt the vibrations and it was unreal. Someone pressed one against my other check, so that my face was sandwiched between these two vibrating balloons. I could barely function. It was that intense and amazing.\n\nI remember having to swallow my gum while dancing because I had literally chewed it apart. Not 10 seconds later, someone tapped me on the shoulder and handed me a piece of gum. I turned and thanked them and asked how they knew, because gum was exactly what I needed right then. He just smiled at me.\n\nI remember eventually taking a piss break. I peed for like 40 seconds. I know this sounds weird, but it was literally the best piss I've ever taken. I remember telling my group this fact and they all agreed with me that peeing felt awesome.\n\nI remember not having a care in the world. I remember feeling like there was nothing bad or evil in the universe. I remember feeling like the entire universe was sending me good vibes. I remember feeling connected with every person that had ever rolled. I remember feeling in love with the 7 people in my rolling group, especially Ashley who I danced with for a lot of the night, and Justin because of his role (no pun intended) in bringing me to this wonderful place. I remember feeling in love with V and C. I remember being in love with everyone I knew.\n\nI remember other things too, but this is long enough already. Eventually the rave started to end and we left and returned home. I couldn't believe that I had spent almost 6 hours there, just dancing and feeling great. It felt like 15 minutes.\n\nI was still rolling, although I could tell that it was lessening, when I finally got back to my dorm. I looked at my eyes in the mirror and my pupils were incredibly dilated. I put on some music and had a one man dance party in my room. Eventually, I moved to my bed and just lay there, feeling the coolness of the AC, the softness of my sheets, and listening to the beautiful music. I lay there for a while before I eventually fell asleep.\n\nThe only negative effects the next day was the expected pain in my jaw from chewing gum way too hard all night and clenching my jaw. I'll have to invest in a mouthguard thingy next time. I was a little out of it all day, too. But no real hangover, which I was thankful for.\n\nI understand that people are cautious when it comes to certain drugs, and E is one of them. I can understand not wanting to try it because of worries about how it will affect you, not wanting to get addicted, not wanting to mess up your mind or whatever. That is all perfectly sound reasoning and I respect it. But it would make me happy if every person in my life that I loved tried E just once and had an experience as wonderful as mine. I want everyone I care about to feel as amazing as I did that night. I know this won't happen and can't happen, and I'm okay with that. But if I ever get a text from someone I know that reads like the ones I sent out that night ('Rolling. Rave. Love you.') then I will be incredibly happy.\n\n","Article 1201: Scope and Coverage\n1.

So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress and congratulating you, Mr. Speaker.\nIf we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994. And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992.\nI must say that in both years we didn't hear America singing, we heard America shouting. And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must say, \"We hear you. We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us. For we are the keepers of a sacred trust, and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era.\"\nOver 200 years ago, our Founders changed the entire course of human history by joining together to create a new country based on a single powerful idea: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, . . . endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, and among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\nIt has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea, the American idea, and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times: to Lincoln and to his Congress to preserve the Union and to end slavery; to Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to restrain the abuses and excesses of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world; to Franklin Roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the Great Depression and to win our country's great struggle against fascism; and to all our Presidents since to fight the cold war. Especially, I recall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with Congresses where the majority was of a different party: to Harry Truman, who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the architecture of the cold war; and to Ronald Reagan, whom we wish well tonight and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against communism was won.\nIn another time of change and challenge, I had the honor to be the first President to be elected in the post-cold-war era, an era marked by the global economy, the information revolution, unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for the American people. I came to this hallowed Chamber 2 years ago on a mission, to restore the American dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world. I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored. In this effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes, and I have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor. But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was 2 years ago. Thank you.\nRecord numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global economy. We are at peace, and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world. We have almost 6 million new jobs since I became President, and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. Our businesses are more productive. And here we have worked to bring the deficit down, to expand trade, to put more police on our streets, to give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities.\nBut the rising tide is not lifting all boats. While our Nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our people are still working harder and harder, for less and less. While our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and competitive, too many of our people still can't be sure of having a job next year or even next month. And far more than our material riches are threatened, things far more precious to us, our children, our families, our values.\nOur civil life is suffering in America today. Citizens are working together less and shouting at each other more. The common bonds of community which have been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed. What are we to do about it?\nMore than 60 years ago, at the dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt told our Nation, \"New conditions impose new requirements on Government and those who conduct Government.\" And from that simple proposition, he shaped the New Deal, which helped to restore our Nation to prosperity and define the relationship between our people and their Government for half a century.\nThat approach worked in its time. But we today, we face a very different time and very different conditions. We are moving from an industrial age built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility. Our Government, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen by many as simply a captive of narrow interests, putting more burdens on our citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead. The values that used to hold us all together seem to be coming apart.\nSo tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of understandings, not just with Government but, even more important, with one another as Americans.\nThat's what I want to talk with you about tonight. I call it the New Covenant. But it's grounded in a very, very old idea, that all Americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their God-given talents and determination can take them and to give something back to their communities and their country in return. Opportunity and responsibility: They go hand in hand. We can't have one without the other. And our national community can't hold together without both.\nOur New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our people to meet the challenges of a new economy, how we can change the way our Government works to fit a different time, and, above all, how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common purpose. We must have dramatic change in our economy, our Government, and ourselves.\nMy fellow Americans, without regard to party, let us rise to the occasion. Let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride. As we embark on this new course, let us put our country first, remembering that regardless of party label, we are all Americans. And let the final test of everything we do be a simple one: Is it good for the American people?\nLet me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not better servants. You made a good start by passing that law which applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector, and I was proud to sign it yesterday. But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work around here. Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors of Washington as were here 20 years ago. The American people look at their Capital, and they see a city where the well-connected and the well-protected can work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left out.\nAs the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still doing business as usual; the gifts, the trips, all the things that people are concerned about haven't stopped. Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices. I know there were other considerations in those votes, but I want to use something that I've heard my Republican friends say from time to time, \"There doesn't have to be a law for everything.\" So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists' perks. Just stop. We don't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the American people that things are really changing. But I also hope you will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill, and I'll sign that, too.\nWe should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what they're spending, what they want. We should also curb the role of big money in elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of PAC's. And as I have said for 3 years, we should work to open the airwaves so that they can be an instrument of democracy, not a weapon of destruction, by giving free TV time to candidates for public office.\nWhen the last Congress killed political reform last year, it was reported in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the Halls of this sacred building and cheered. This year, let's give the folks at home something to cheer about.\nMore important, I think we all agree that we have to change the way the Government works. Let's make it smaller, less costly, and smarter; leaner, not meaner.\nI just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine is alive and well.\nThe New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter. The old way of governing around here protected organized interests. We should look out for the interests of ordinary people. The old way divided us by interest, constituency, or class. The New Covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of what's best for our country. The old way dispensed services through large, top-down, inflexible bureaucracies. The New Covenant way should shift these resources and decisionmaking from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy. The old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure. The New Covenant way should have built-in incentives to reward success. The old way was centralized here in Washington. The New Covenant way must take hold in the communities all across America. And we should help them to do that.\nOur job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy, to empower people to make the most of their own lives, and to enhance our security here at home and abroad. We must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves. We should rely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for each other.\nI hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters, we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is somehow a program for every problem, on the one hand, and the other illusion that the Government is a source of every problem we have. Our job is to get rid of yesterday's Government so that our own people can meet today's and tomorrow's needs. And we ought to do it together.\nYou know, for years before I became President, I heard others say they would cut Government and how bad it was, but not much happened. We actually did it. We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending, more than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions from the Federal bureaucracy in the last 2 years alone. Based on decisions already made, we will have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million positions from the Federal Government, making it the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was President, by the time I come here again next year.\nUnder the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have already saved taxpayers $63 billion. The age of the $500 hammer and the ashtray you can break on \"David Letterman\" is gone. Deadwood programs, like mohair subsidies, are gone. We've streamlined the Agriculture Department by reducing it by more than 1,200 offices. We've slashed the small business loan form from an inch thick to a single page. We've thrown away the Government's 10,000-page personnel manual.\nAnd the Government is working better in important ways: FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has gone from being a disaster to helping people in disasters. You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or the people in California who have dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires, and they'll tell you that. Government workers, working hand in hand with private business, rebuilt southern California's fractured freeways in record time and under budget. And because the Federal Government moved fast, all but one of the 5,600 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business.\nNow, there are a lot of other things that I could talk about. I want to just mention one because it will be discussed here in the next few weeks. University administrators all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable with better repayment terms for students, costs the Government less, and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the Government and for the universities. We shouldn't cap that program. We should give every college in America the opportunity to be a part of it.\nPrevious Government programs gathered dust. The reinventing Government report is getting results. And we're not through. There's going to be a second round of reinventing Government. We propose to cut $130 billion in spending by shrinking departments, extending our freeze on domestic spending, cutting 60 public housing programs down to 3, getting rid of over 100 programs we do not need, like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program. And we're working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more sensible. The programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should go. We have to cut yesterday's Government to help solve tomorrow's problems.\nAnd we need to get Government closer to the people it's meant to serve. We need to help move programs down to the point where States and communities and private citizens in the private sector can do a better job. If they can do it, we ought to let them do it. We should get out of the way and let them do what they can do better. Taking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for.\nIt's time for Congress to stop passing on to the States the cost of decisions we make here in Washington. I know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded mandates legislation, but I want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interests and give justified relief where we need to give it.\nFor years, Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending projects. Last year was no difference. There was a $1 million to study stress in plants and $12 million for a tick removal program that didn't work. It's hard to remove ticks. Those of us who have had them know. But I'll tell you something, if you'll give me line-item veto, I'll remove some of that unnecessary spending.\nBut I think we should all remember, and almost all of us would agree, that Government still has important responsibilities. Our young people—we should think of this when we cut—our young people hold our future in their hands. We still owe a debt to our veterans. And our senior citizens have made us what we are. Now, my budget cuts a lot. But it protects education, veterans, Social Security, and Medicare, and I hope you will do the same thing. You should, and I hope you will.\nAnd when we give more flexibility to the States, let us remember that there are certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every State, North and South, East and West: Immunization against childhood disease, school lunches in all our schools, Head Start, medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants, all these things, all these things are in the national interest.\nI applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations. But when we deregulate, let's remember what national action in the national interest has given us: safer food for our families, safer toys for our children, safer nursing homes for our parents, safer cars and highways, and safer workplaces, cleaner air, and cleaner water. Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations? You bet we do. But we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water. We can have fairness and still clean up toxic dumps, and we ought to do it.\nShould we cut the deficit more? Well, of course we should. Of course we should. But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic recovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished but instead should be helped.\nI know many of you in this Chamber support the balanced budget amendment. I certainly want to balance the budget. Our administration has done more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very, very long time. If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do, then you have to be straight with the American people. They have a right to know what you're going to cut, what taxes you're going to raise, and how it's going to affect them. We should be doing things in the open around here. For example, everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social Security. I would oppose that, and I think most Americans would.\nNothing has done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our failed welfare system. This is one of the problems we have to face here in Washington in our New Covenant. It rewards welfare over work. It undermines family values. It lets millions of parents get away without paying their child support. It keeps a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time.\nI've worked on this problem for a long time, nearly 15 years now. As a Governor, I had the honor of working with the Reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988. In the last 2 years, we made a good start at continuing the work of welfare reform. Our administration gave two dozen States the right to slash through Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency.\nLast year I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by an administration. We have to make welfare what it was meant to be, a second chance, not a way of life. We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible, to provide child care and teach them skills, if that's what they need, for up to 2 years. And after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule: Anyone who can work must go to work. If a parent isn't paying child support, they should be forced to pay. We should suspend drivers' license, track them across State lines, make them work off what they owe. That is what we should do. Governments do not raise children, people do. And the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world.\nI want to work with you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform. But our goal must be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to independence, from welfare to work, from mere childbearing to responsible parenting. Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor.\nWe should, we should require work and mutual responsibility. But we shouldn't cut people off just because they're poor, they're young, or even because they're unmarried. We should promote responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised settings, by requiring them to finish school. But we shouldn't put them and their children out on the street. And I know all the arguments, pro and con, and I have read and thought about this for a long time. I still don't think we can in good conscience punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.\nMy fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the American people care about this without regard to party or race or region. So let this be the year we end welfare as we know it. But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue to divide America. No one is more eager to end welfareI may be the only President who has actually had the opportunity to sit in a welfare office, who's actually spent hours and hours talking to people on welfare. And I am telling you, the people who are trapped on it know it doesn't work; they also want to get off. So we can promote, together, education and work and good parenting. I have no problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent. I just don't want to punish poverty and past mistakes. All of us have made our mistakes, and none of us can change our yesterdays. But every one of us can change our tomorrows. And America's best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey, who worked her way off welfare to become a Congresswoman from the State of California.\nI know the Members of this Congress are concerned about crime, as are all the citizens of our country. And I remind you that last year we passed a very tough crime bill: longer sentences, \"three strikes and you're out,\" almost 60 new capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention, 100,000 more police. And we paid for it all by reducing the size of the Federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower the crime rate.\nThere may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be smarter with crime, to help to lower that rate first. Well, if there are, let's talk about them, and let's do them. But let's not go back on the things that we did last year that we know work, that we know work because the local law enforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing, because local community leaders who have worked for years and years to lower the crime rate tell us that they work. Let's look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it. And if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate—and I am convinced that it does—let us not go back on it. Let's stick with it, implement it. We've got 4 more hard years of work to do to do that.\nI don't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight, but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly last year. The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and, in the crime bill, the ban on 19 assault weapons. I don't think it's a secret to anybody in this room that several Members of the last Congress who voted for that aren't here tonight because they voted for it. And I know, therefore, that some of you who are here because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it. I just have to tell you how I feel about it.\nThe Members of Congress who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activities. I've done it since I was a boy, and I'm going to keep right on doing it until I can't do it anymore. But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of assault weapon attack, and I will not let that be repealed. I will not let it be repealed.\nI'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with. I want us to cut more spending, but I hope we won't cut Government programs that help to prepare us for the new economy, promote responsibility, and are organized from the grassroots up, not by Federal bureaucracy. The very best example of this is the national service corps, AmeriCorps. It passed with strong bipartisan support. And now there are 20,000 Americans, more than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps, working all over this country, helping people person-to-person in local grassroots volunteer groups, solving problems, and in the process earning some money for their education. This is citizenship at its best. It's good for the AmeriCorps members, but it's good for the rest of us, too. It's the essence of the New Covenant, and we shouldn't stop it.\nAll Americans, not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens. In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.\nThe most important job of our Government in this new era is to empower the American people to succeed in the global economy. America has always been a land of opportunity, a land where, if you work hard, you can get ahead. We've become a great middle class country. Middle class values sustain us. We must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass, even as we do everything we can to support the millions of Americans who are already successful in the new economy.\nAmerica is once again the world's strongest economic power: almost 6 million new jobs in the last 2 years, exports booming, inflation down. High-wage jobs are coming back. A record number of American entrepreneurs are living the American dream. If we want it to stay that way, those who work and lift our Nation must have more of its benefits.\nToday, too many of those people are being left out. They're working harder for less. They have less security, less income, less certainty that they can even afford a vacation, much less college for their kids or retirement for themselves. We cannot let this continue. If we don't act, our economy will probably keep doing what it's been doing since about 1978, when the income growth began to go to those at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle got very little growth, and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then fell even further and further behind in the years afterward, no matter how hard they worked.\nWe've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this new economy work for all of our people, a Government that helps each and every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skills. That's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the last 2 years, from Head Start to public schools, to apprenticeships for young people who don't go to college, to making college loans more available and more affordable. That's the first thing we have to do. We've got to do something to empower people to improve their skills.\nThe second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes immediately by lowering their taxes. We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million families with incomes under $27,000, a tax cut that this year will average about $1,000 a family. And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses. Before we could do more than that, we first had to bring down the deficit we inherited, and we had to get economic growth up. Now we've done both. And now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way. But tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation: to empower our citizens through education and training to make the most of their own lives. The spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for themselves, their families, and their communities.\nI have proposed the middle class bill of rights, which should properly be called the bill of rights and responsibilities because its provisions only benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to educate themselves. It will, therefore, give needed tax relief and raise incomes in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefits all of us.\nThere are four provisions. First, a tax deduction for all education and training after high school. If you think about it, we permit businesses to deduct their investment, we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages, but today an education is even more important to the economic well-being of our whole country than even those things are. We should do everything we can to encourage it. And I hope you will support it. Second, we ought to cut taxes $500 for families with children under 13. Third, we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by permitting people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education, health care, first-time homebuying, or the care of a parent. And fourth, we should pass a GI bill for America's workers. We propose to collapse nearly 70 Federal programs and not give the money to the States but give the money directly to the American people, offer vouchers to them so that they, if they're laid off or if they're working for a very low wage, can get a voucher worth $2,600 a year for up to 2 years to go to their local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills they need to improve their lives. Let's empower people in this way, move it from the Government directly to the workers of America.\nNow, any one of us can call for a tax cut, but I won't accept one that explodes the deficit or puts our recovery at risk. We ought to pay for our tax cuts fully and honestly.\nJust 2 years ago, it was an open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit. Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then, many of whom didn't return, we did cut the deficit. We began to do what others said would not be done. We cut the deficit by over $600 billion, about $10,000 for every family in this country. It's coming down 3 years in a row for the first time since Mr. Truman was President, and I don't think anybody in America wants us to let it explode again.\nIn the budget I will send you, the middle class bill of rights is fully paid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy, cuts in programs, cuts in special interest subsidies. And the spending cuts will more than double the tax cuts. My budget pays for the middle class bill of rights without any cuts in Medicare. And I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with Medicare cuts. That's not the right thing to do.\nI know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief, and some of them I find quite interesting. I really want to work with all of you. My test for our proposals will be: Will it create jobs and raise incomes; will it strengthen our families and support our children; is it paid for; will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass? If it does, I'll support it. But if it doesn't, I won't.\nThe goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is also why I believe that you should raise the minimum wage. It rewards work. Two and a half million Americans, two and a half million Americans, often women with children, are working out there today for $4.25 an hour. In terms of real buying power, by next year that minimum wage will be at a 40-year low. That's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work.\nNow, I've studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum wage increase. I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market. But the most important thing is, you can't make a living on $4.25 an hour, especially if you have children, even with the working families tax cut we passed last year. In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue, and I think it should be again. So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on this, to get together, to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage.\nMembers of Congress have been here less than a month, but by the end of the week, 28 days into the new year, every Member of Congress will have earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker makes all year long.\nEverybody else here, including the President, has something else that too many Americans do without, and that's health care. Now, last year we almost came to blows over health care, but we didn't do anything. And the cold, hard fact is that, since last year, since I was here, another 1.1 million Americans in working families have lost their health care. And the cold, hard fact is that many millions more, most of them farmers and small business people and self-employed people, have seen their premiums skyrocket, their copays and deductibles go up. There's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have health insurance but really what they've got is a piece of paper that says they won't lose their home if they get sick.\nNow, I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health security for every American family. But I know that last year, as the evidence indicates, we bit off more than we could chew. So I'm asking you that we work together. Let's do it step by step. Let's do whatever we have to do to get something done. Let's at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage for facing skyrocketing prices, that nobody loses their coverage because they face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or lose a job or a family member gets sick.\nI want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this, with the Democrats who worked on it last time, with the Republican leaders like Senator Dole, who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made some constructive proposals in this area last year. We ought to make sure that self-employed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools. We ought to help families provide long-term care for a sick parent or a disabled child. We can work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work. And we can find a way—it may take some time, but we can find a way—to make sure that our children have health care.\nYou know, I think everybody in this room, without regard to party, can be proud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world's most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade. But we can't be proud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the world that has a smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health insurance today than we did 10 years ago, the last time we were the most productive economy in the world. So let's work together on this. It is too important for politics as usual.\nMuch of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we've already talked about. A lot of people think that the security concerns of America today are entirely internal to our borders. They relate to the security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children, our streets, our health, and protecting those borders. Now that the cold war has passed, it's tempting to believe that all the security issues, with the possible exception of trade, reside here at home. But it's not so. Our security still depends upon our continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy. We still can't be strong at home unless we're strong abroad.\nThe financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point. I know it's not popular to say it tonight, but we have to act, not for the Mexican people but for the sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to Mexico's well-being. If we want to secure American jobs, preserve American exports, safeguard America's borders, then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put Mexico back on track.\nNow let me repeat: It's not a loan; it's not foreign aid; it's not a bailout. We will be given a guarantee like cosigning a note, with good collateral that will cover our risks. This legislation is the right thing for America. That's why the bipartisan leadership has supported it. And I hope you in Congress will pass it quickly. It is in our interest, and we can explain it to the American people because we're going to do it in the right way.\nYou know, tonight, this is the first State of the Union Address ever delivered since the beginning of the cold war when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America. And along with the Russians, we're on our way to destroying the missiles and the bombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads. We've come so far so fast in this post-cold-war world that it's easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for granted. But it's still there, and we aren't finished yet.\nThis year I'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons that carry 5,000 more warheads. The United States will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical weapons. To stop and roll back North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear program, we'll continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation. It's smart. It's tough. It's a deal based on continuing inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves.\nThis year I'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home or abroad. As the cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out, this country will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice.\nJust this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and injured scores more. On behalf of the American people and all of you, I send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in the face of such evil, it is hard for the people in the Middle East to go forward. But the terrorists represent the past, not the future. We must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors in the Middle East.\nAccordingly, last night I signed an Executive order that will block the assets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the peace process. It prohibits financial transactions with these groups. And tonight I call on all our allies and peace-loving nations throughout the world to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism. We cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and paralysis.\nFrom the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our Nation would maintain the best equipped, best trained, and best prepared military on Earth. We have, and they are. They have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit. But to make sure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their families deserve, I'm asking the Congress to add $25 billion in defense spending over the next 6 years.\nI have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became President. Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction. We ask a very great deal of our Armed Forces. Now that they are smaller in number, we ask more of them. They go out more often to more different places and stay longer. They are called to service in many, many ways. And we must give them and their families what the times demand and what they have earned.\nJust think about what our troops have done in the last year, showing America at its best, helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda, moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait, giving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti. We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South Africa to Northern Ireland, from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia, from Latin America to the Middle East. All these endeavors are good in those places, but they make our future more confident and more secure.\nWell, my fellow Americans, that's my agenda for America's future: expanding opportunity, not bureaucracy; enhancing security at home and abroad; empowering our people to make the most of their own lives. It's ambitious and achievable, but it's not enough. We even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping Americans to compete in the new economy, more than a Government that's smaller, smarter, and wiser, more than all of the changes we can make in Government and in the private sector from the outside in.\nOur fortunes and our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer some questions from within, from the values and voices that speak to our hearts as well as our heads; voices that tell us we have to do more to accept responsibility for ourselves and our families, for our communities, and yes, for our fellow citizens. We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart, and we feel the common ground shifting from under us. The PTA, the town hall meeting, the ball park, it's hard for a lot of overworked parents to find the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation. Too many of our children don't even have parents and grandparents who can give them those experiences that they need to build their own character and their sense of identity.\nWe all know what while we here in this Chamber can make a difference on those things, that the real differences will be made by our fellow citizens, where they work and where they live and that it will be made almost without regard to party. When I used to go to the softball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter's league, and people would come up to me, fathers and mothers, and talk to me, I can honestly say I had no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or Democrats. When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California, northern California, last week, a woman came up to me and did something that very few of you would do. She hugged me and said, \"Mr. President, I'm a Republican, but I'm glad you're here.\"\nNow, why? We can't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every day, because as we move into this next century, everybody matters. We don't have a person to waste. And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to do better. That means that we need a New Covenant for everybody.\nFor our corporate and business leaders, we're going to work here to keep bringing the deficit down, to expand markets, to support their success in every possible way. But they have an obligation when they're doing well to keep jobs in our communities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate.\nFor people in the entertainment industry in this country, we applaud your creativity and your worldwide success, and we support your freedom of expression. But you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant, repetitive, mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media all the time.\nWe've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to help us stop our most serious social problem, the epidemic of teen pregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I have sent to Congress a plan to target schools all over this country with antipregnancy programs that work. But Government can only do so much. Tonight I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference. We can do this, and we must.\nAnd I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders. You know, I'm proud of the fact the United States has more houses of worship per capita than any country in the world. These people who lead our houses of worship can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action, can reach out to all of our children, to all of the people in distress, to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear. Because so much of what must be done must come from the inside out and our religious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference, they have a role in the New Covenant as well.\nThere must be more responsibility for all of our citizens. You know, it takes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets and in school. It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity houses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin. It takes a lot of people to provide the people power for all of the civic organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were kids. It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be.\nI know it's hard when you're working harder for less, when you're under great stress to do these things. A lot of our people don't have the time or the emotional stress, they think, to do the work of citizenship.\nMost of us in politics haven't helped very much. For years, we've mostly treated citizens like they were consumers or spectators, sort of political couch potatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads either promise them something for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations. And more and more of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive ways that are hardly conducive to honest and open conversations. But the truth is, we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different views.\nIf you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of America, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago, has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And in this day, everybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply cannot want for a tornado, a fire, or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another.\nI want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the First Lady that represent what I'm trying to talk about—citizens. I have no idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last election. But they represent what we ought to be doing.\nCindy Perry teaches second graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural Kentucky. She gains when she gives. She's a mother of four. She says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency last year. She was married when she was a teenager—stand up, Cindy. She was married when she was a teenager. She had four children. But she had time to serve other people, to get her high school equivalency, and she's going to use her AmeriCorps money to go back to college.\nChief Stephen Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City. He's been a national leader—stand up, Steve. He's been a national leader in using more police in community policing, and he's worked with AmeriCorps to do it. And the crime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he did.\nCorporal Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country's force to help secure democracy in his native land. And I might add, we must be the only country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken Haitian-Americans there who could speak the language and talk to the people. And he was one of them, and we're proud of him.\nThe next two folks I've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a little bit, the Reverend John and the Reverend Diana Cherry of the AME Zion Church in Temple Hills, Maryland. I'd like to ask them to stand. I want to tell you about them. In the early eighties, they left Government service and formed a church in a small living room in a small house, in the early eighties. Today that church has 17,000 members. It is one of the three or four biggest churches in the entire United States. It grows by 200 a month. They do it together. And the special focus of their ministry is keeping families together.\nTwo things they did make a big impression on me. I visited their church once, and I learned they were building a new sanctuary closer to the Washington, DC, line in a higher crime, higher drug rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them. The second thing I want to say is that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House with some other religious leaders, and he left early to go back to this church to minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all over America to convince them to come back together, to save their marriages, and to raise their kids. This is the kind of work that citizens are doing in America. We need more of it, and it ought to be lifted up and supported.\nThe last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Jack, would you stand up? Fifty years ago, in the sands of Iwo Jima, Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship. On February 20th, 1945, he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them. In that moment, he saved the lives of his companions, and miraculously in the next instant, a medic saved his life. He gained a foothold for freedom, and at the age of 17, just a year older than his grandson who is up there with him today—and his son, who is a West Point graduate and a veteran—at 17, Jack Lucas became the youngest Marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor. All these years later, yesterday, here's what he said about that day: \"It didn't matter where you were from or who you were, you relied on one another. You did it for your country.\"\nWe all gain when we give, and we reap what we sow. That's at the heart of this New Covenant. Responsibility, opportunity, and citizenship, more than stale chapters in some remote civic book, they're still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the enduring dream from that first and most sacred covenant. I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our Creator the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This is a very, very great country. And our best days are still to come.\nThank you, and God bless you all.\n","Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.\nOh, yeah, good idea.\nHey man, what's up?Ooh, Ross, look!

Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.\nSo all we have is ice?\nSee if he has ice.\nOkay.\nI know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.\nOh. Oh!\nSo where are we going next?\nThis witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.\nSur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?\nCome on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?\nIt's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!\nYeah, no one talks like that!\nOh what? Like your Mr. Cop!\nHey, I'm more cop than you two!\nHow do you figure that?\nHello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!\nY'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.\nUmm, jealous!\nHey, do you mind? We're under cover here.\nYeah, no problem.\nRoss!\nSorry! Sorry! Oh, Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!\nLook at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.\nYeah, what's up with that Serpico?\nAre you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.\nNooo!\nI know!\nWell thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!\nWhat?! We can't do that!\nWe have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?\nNoo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!\nI'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?\nI don't think he's the one who needs help.\nNo, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.\nUgh!\nY'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.\nOkay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!\nAnswering Machine: Your messages have been erased.\nNoooooooo!\nOkay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!\nNo. But that reminds me, sign this.\nWhat is it?\nOh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.\nOh, hurry up. I want to sign that.\nOkay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!\nWhat? What? What? What is it?\nIs everything okay?\nWhat's going on?\nOkay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.\nHey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?\nYou okay man?\nUh-huh. Thank Joey!\nUh, HELLO!!\nHi.\nAll right, I guess we should go.\nNo, wait. Wait.\nOh yeah right!\nNo, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!\nThere's nothing we can do. You erased the message!\nYeah well unless we tell him.\nWell, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.\nOh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!\nRight?\nHey, anybody want to meet a hero?\nJohn Glenn is here?!\nNo, Joey!\nPheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car…\nWait! Hold on! Hi!\nHi!\nOkay, go ahead.\nOkay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!\nMy God, Joey!\nIt was a car backfire!\nYeah, but-but he didn't know that!\nYeah, I didn't know that.\nAnd it could've just as easily have been a bullet.\nHey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.\nWho jumps at loud noises!\nWow! I could've died tonight.\nYeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.\nI do have a newfound respect for life.So you wanna get some dinner?\nYeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.\nOh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.\nOkay!\nAll right.\nBye!\nBye!\nCut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!\nDude! How come you took off?\nOh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…\nIs something wrong?\nNo. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.\nOkay.\nYou dove in front of Ross! Ross!\nThat's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!\nI do not hate Ross!\nOf course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.\nWhat picture?\nI don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!\nLook I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!\nOhh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!\nWhen it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.\nWell, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.\nFrom a bullet!\nI know it doesn't make much sense…\nMuch sense?!\nLook Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!\nSo you risked your life, for a sandwich!\nI know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!\nSo you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.\nNo! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!\nReally?!\nYeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.\nThanks.\nNo, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!\nHow good is that?\nOh-oi-ho, yeah!\nSee?\nHm-hmm.\nOh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!\nI thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.\nYeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!\nHey! Hi!\nRach, what uh, what are you doing here?\nHey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!\nY'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!\nOkay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?\nThe most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!\nWhat?! What? What happened?!\nOkay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?\nYeah!\nAnd somebody took a shot at me!\nReally?!\nNo, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.\nBecause a car backfired?\nOkay, why are you here?\nWell, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole \"seizing\" thing but um, Emily called you today.\nYou talked to her?\nNo, she left a message. something wrong with your machine.\nWell, okay, what-what did she say?\nWell, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.\nWow!\nNow, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?\nHuh? Yeah! Yes, of course!\nOkay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.\nRight. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.\nOkay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?\nOkay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!\nUgh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!\nYou weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?\nOkay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.\nHuh.\nI mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?\nThat does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.\nWell, there you go!\nYeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.\nClose call day.\nHey, thanks Rach.\nOhh, honey no problem. Okay.\nOh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.\nOh?\nOh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.\nNo.\nHey umm, was-was Monica here?\nYeah.\nYeah, I want my money back.\nYeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?\nHey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?\nYes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.\nI wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.\nMan, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.\nBefore or after you were shot by your own troops?\nI know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.\nYes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.\nYeah, hero sandwiches.\nWell you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. Not you Joey.\n","THE King’s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.\nHe had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.\nShe was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a\nsledge drawn by six reindeer.  The sledge was shaped like a great golden\nswan, and between the swan’s wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her\nlong ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny\ncap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she\nhad always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets\nall the people wondered.  “She is like a white rose!” they cried, and\nthey threw down flowers on her from the balconies.\n\nAt the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had\ndreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he\nsank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\n\n“Your picture was beautiful,” he murmured, “but you are more beautiful\nthan your picture”; and the little Princess blushed.\n\n“She was like a white rose before,” said a young Page to his neighbour,\n“but she is like a red rose now”; and the whole Court was delighted.\n\nFor the next three days everybody went about saying, “White rose, Red\nrose, Red rose, White rose”; and the King gave orders that the Page’s\nsalary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not\nof much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly\npublished in the Court Gazette.\n\nWhen the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a\nmagnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand\nunder a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then\nthere was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and\nPrincess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear\ncrystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips\ntouched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.\n\n“It’s quite clear that they love each other,” said the little Page, “as\nclear as crystal!” and the King doubled his salary a second time.  “What\nan honour!” cried all the courtiers.\n\nAfter the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were\nto dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the\nflute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so,\nbecause he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never\nquite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for,\nwhatever he did, everybody cried out, “Charming! charming!”\n\nThe last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be\nlet off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a\nfirework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal\nPyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.\n\n“What are fireworks like?” she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she\nwas walking on the terrace.\n\n“They are like the Aurora Borealis,” said the King, who always answered\nquestions that were addressed to other people, “only much more natural.\nI prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to\nappear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must\ncertainly see them.”\n\nSo at the end of the King’s garden a great stand had been set up, and as\nsoon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place,\nthe fireworks began to talk to each other.\n\n“The world is certainly very beautiful,” cried a little Squib.  “Just\nlook at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could\nnot be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the\nmind wonderfully, and does away with all one’s prejudices.”\n\n“The King’s garden is not the world, you foolish squib,” said a big Roman\nCandle; “the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days\nto see it thoroughly.”\n\n“Any place you love is the world to you,” exclaimed a pensive Catherine\nWheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided\nherself on her broken heart; “but love is not fashionable any more, the\npoets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed\nthem, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I\nremember myself once—But it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the\npast.”\n\n“Nonsense!” said the Roman Candle, “Romance never dies.  It is like the\nmoon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love\neach other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a\nbrown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as\nmyself, and knew the latest Court news.”\n\nBut the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  “Romance is dead, Romance is\ndead, Romance is dead,” she murmured.  She was one of those people who\nthink that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times,\nit becomes true in the end.\n\nSuddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.\n\nIt came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end\nof a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as\nto attract attention.\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine\nWheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, “Romance is dead.”\n\n“Order! order!” cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician,\nand had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew\nthe proper Parliamentary expressions to use.\n\n“Quite dead,” whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.\n\nAs soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and\nbegan.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating\nhis memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he\nwas talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.\n\n“How fortunate it is for the King’s son,” he remarked, “that he is to be\nmarried on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had\nbeen arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him;\nbut, Princes are always lucky.”\n\n“Dear me!” said the little Squib, “I thought it was quite the other way,\nand that we were to be let off in the Prince’s honour.”\n\n“It may be so with you,” he answered; “indeed, I have no doubt that it\nis, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come\nof remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel\nof her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her\ngreat public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went\nout, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink\nstars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very\nbest gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French\nextraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would\nnever come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly\ndisposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden\nrain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering\nterms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic\nart.”\n\n“Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,” said a Bengal Light; “I know it is\nPyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.”\n\n“Well, I said Pylotechnic,” answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of\nvoice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to\nbully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of\nsome importance.\n\n“I was saying,” continued the Rocket, “I was saying—What was I saying?”\n\n“You were talking about yourself,” replied the Roman Candle.\n\n“Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was\nso rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind,\nfor I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive\nas I am, I am quite sure of that.”\n\n“What is a sensitive person?” said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.\n\n“A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other\npeople’s toes,” answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the\nCracker nearly exploded with laughter.\n\n“Pray, what are you laughing at?” inquired the Rocket; “I am not\nlaughing.”\n\n“I am laughing because I am happy,” replied the Cracker.\n\n“That is a very selfish reason,” said the Rocket angrily.  “What right\nhave you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you\nshould be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I\nexpect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.\nIt is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose,\nfor instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that\nwould be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy\nagain, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I\nknow he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the\nimportance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.”\n\n“If you want to give pleasure to others,” cried the Roman Candle, “you\nhad better keep yourself dry.”\n\n“Certainly,” exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits;\n“that is only common sense.”\n\n“Common sense, indeed!” said the Rocket indignantly; “you forget that I\nam very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common\nsense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination,\nfor I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as\nbeing quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no\none here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for\nmyself, I don’t care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is\nthe consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this\nis a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any\nhearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and\nPrincess had not just been married.”\n\n“Well, really,” exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, “why not?  It is a most\njoyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the\nstars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about\nthe pretty bride.”\n\n“Ah! what a trivial view of life!” said the Rocket; “but it is only what\nI expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why,\nperhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there\nis a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little\nfair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps\nsome day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may\ngo to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall\ninto the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor\npeople, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall\nnever get over it.”\n\n“But they have not lost their only son,” said the Roman Candle; “no\nmisfortune has happened to them at all.”\n\n“I never said that they had,” replied the Rocket; “I said that they\nmight.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying\nanything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.\nBut when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very\nmuch affected.”\n\n“You certainly are!” cried the Bengal Light.  “In fact, you are the most\naffected person I ever met.”\n\n“You are the rudest person I ever met,” said the Rocket, “and you cannot\nunderstand my friendship for the Prince.”\n\n“Why, you don’t even know him,” growled the Roman Candle.\n\n“I never said I knew him,” answered the Rocket.  “I dare say that if I\nknew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing\nto know one’s friends.”\n\n“You had really better keep yourself dry,” said the Fire-balloon.  “That\nis the important thing.”\n\n“Very important for you, I have no doubt,” answered the Rocket, “but I\nshall weep if I choose”; and he actually burst into real tears, which\nflowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little\nbeetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were\nlooking for a nice dry spot to live in.\n\n“He must have a truly romantic nature,” said the Catherine Wheel, “for he\nweeps when there is nothing at all to weep about”; and she heaved a deep\nsigh, and thought about the deal box.\n\nBut the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept\nsaying, “Humbug! humbug!” at the top of their voices.  They were\nextremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called\nit humbug.\n\nThen the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to\nshine, and a sound of music came from the palace.\n\nThe Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so\nbeautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and\nwatched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.\n\nThen ten o’clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the\nlast stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King\nsent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.\n\n“Let the fireworks begin,” said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made\na low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six\nattendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a\nlong pole.\n\nIt was certainly a magnificent display.\n\nWhizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.\nBoom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the\nplace, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  “Good-bye,”\ncried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.\nBang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves\nimmensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.\nHe was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best\nthing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it\nwas of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak,\nexcept with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers\nwith blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little\nPrincess laughed with pleasure.\n\n“I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,” said the\nRocket; “no doubt that is what it means,” and he looked more supercilious\nthan ever.\n\nThe next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  “This is evidently\na deputation,” said the Rocket; “I will receive them with becoming\ndignity” so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if\nhe were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no\nnotice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them\ncaught sight of him.  “Hallo!” he cried, “what a bad rocket!” and he\nthrew him over the wall into the ditch.\n\n“BAD Rocket?  BAD Rocket?” he said, as he whirled through the air;\n“impossible!  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.  BAD and GRAND\nsound very much the same, indeed they often are the same”; and he fell\ninto the mud.\n\n“It is not comfortable here,” he remarked, “but no doubt it is some\nfashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my\nhealth.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require\nrest.”\n\nThen a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat,\nswam up to him.\n\n“A new arrival, I see!” said the Frog.  “Well, after all there is nothing\nlike mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do\nyou think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky\nis quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket, and he began to cough.\n\n“What a delightful voice you have!” cried the Frog.  “Really it is quite\nlike a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the\nworld.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck\npond close by the farmer’s house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.\nIt is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact,\nit was only yesterday that I heard the farmer’s wife say to her mother\nthat she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is\nmost gratifying to find oneself so popular.”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he\ncould not get a word in.\n\n“A delightful voice, certainly,” continued the Frog; “I hope you will\ncome over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have\nsix beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He\nis a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off\nthem.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I\nassure you.”\n\n“Conversation, indeed!” said the Rocket.  “You have talked the whole time\nyourself.  That is not conversation.”\n\n“Somebody must listen,” answered the Frog, “and I like to do all the\ntalking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.”\n\n“But I like arguments,” said the Rocket.\n\n“I hope not,” said the Frog complacently.  “Arguments are extremely\nvulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.\nGood-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little\nFrog swam away.\n\n“You are a very irritating person,” said the Rocket, “and very ill-bred.\nI hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to\ntalk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and\nselfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my\ntemperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you\nshould take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.\nNow that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I\nam going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at\nCourt; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my\nhonour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a\nprovincial.”\n\n“There is no good talking to him,” said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on\nthe top of a large brown bulrush; “no good at all, for he has gone away.”\n\n“Well, that is his loss, not mine,” answered the Rocket.  “I am not going\nto stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like\nhearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have\nlong conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I\ndon’t understand a single word of what I am saying.”\n\n“Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,” said the Dragon-fly;\nand he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.\n\n“How very silly of him not to stay here!” said the Rocket.  “I am sure\nthat he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However,\nI don’t care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some\nday”; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.\n\nAfter some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs,\nand webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her\nwaddle.\n\n“Quack, quack, quack,” she said.  “What a curious shape you are!  May I\nask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?”\n\n“It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,” answered\nthe Rocket, “otherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your\nignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable\nas oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up\ninto the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.”\n\n“I don’t think much of that,” said the Duck, “as I cannot see what use it\nis to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw\na cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that\nwould be something.”\n\n“My good creature,” cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, “I\nsee that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is\nnever useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than\nsufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least\nof all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have\nalways been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who\nhave nothing whatever to do.”\n\n“Well, well,” said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and\nnever quarrelled with any one, “everybody has different tastes.  I hope,\nat any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.”\n\n“Oh! dear no,” cried the Rocket.  “I am merely a visitor, a distinguished\nvisitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is\nneither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban.\nI shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make\na sensation in the world.”\n\n“I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,” remarked the Duck;\n“there are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair\nat a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning\neverything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much\neffect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.”\n\n“I am made for public life,” said the Rocket, “and so are all my\nrelations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great\nattention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will\nbe a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and\ndistracts one’s mind from higher things.”\n\n“Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!” said the Duck; “and\nthat reminds me how hungry I feel”: and she swam away down the stream,\nsaying, “Quack, quack, quack.”\n\n“Come back! come back!” screamed the Rocket, “I have a great deal to say\nto you”; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  “I am glad that she has\ngone,” he said to himself, “she has a decidedly middle-class mind”; and\nhe sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the\nloneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came\nrunning down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.\n\n“This must be the deputation,” said the Rocket, and he tried to look very\ndignified.\n\n“Hallo!” cried one of the boys, “look at this old stick!  I wonder how it\ncame here”; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.\n\n“OLD Stick!” said the Rocket, “impossible!  GOLD Stick, that is what he\nsaid.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one\nof the Court dignitaries!”\n\n“Let us put it into the fire!” said the other boy, “it will help to boil\nthe kettle.”\n\nSo they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit\nthe fire.\n\n“This is magnificent,” cried the Rocket, “they are going to let me off in\nbroad day-light, so that every one can see me.”\n\n“We will go to sleep now,” they said, “and when we wake up the kettle\nwill be boiled”; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.\n\nThe Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last,\nhowever, the fire caught him.\n\n“Now I am going off!” he cried, and he made himself very stiff and\nstraight.  “I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher\nthan the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high\nthat—”\n\nFizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.\n\n“Delightful!” he cried, “I shall go on like this for ever.  What a\nsuccess I am!”\n\nBut nobody saw him.\n\nThen he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.\n\n“Now I am going to explode,” he cried.  “I shall set the whole world on\nfire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for\na whole year.”  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the\ngunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.\n\nBut nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound\nasleep.\n\nThen all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the\nback of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.\n\n“Good heavens!” cried the Goose.  “It is going to rain sticks”; and she\nrushed into the water.\n\n“I knew I should create a great sensation,” gasped the Rocket, and he\nwent out.\n\n","I put down more hits than mafioso made\nAnd Lucky Lucianno 'bout to sing soprano\nAnd I know, I know the way you feel\nAnd baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real\nJust to get you caught up in amazement\nWe puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous\nBut when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack\nAnd let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha\nHow you feelin'?

Jane, his bride, you see, was somewhat older than\nAndrey; how much older I don't pretend to say; she was not one of our\nparish, and the register alone may be able to tell that.  But, at any\nrate, her being a little ahead of her young man in mortal years, coupled\nwith other bodily circumstances--'\n\n('Ah, poor thing!' sighed the women.)\n\n'--made her very anxious to get the thing done before he changed his\nmind; and 'twas with a joyful countenance (they say) that she, with\nAndrey and his brother and sister-in-law, marched off to church one\nNovember morning as soon as 'twas day a'most, to be made one with Andrey\nfor the rest of her life.  He had left our place long before it was\nlight, and the folks that were up all waved their lanterns at him, and\nflung up their hats as he went.\n\n'The church of her parish was a mile and more from the houses, and, as it\nwas a wonderful fine day for the time of year, the plan was that as soon\nas they were married they would make out a holiday by driving straight\noff to Port Bredy, to see the ships and the sea and the sojers, instead\nof coming back to a meal at the house of the distant relation she lived\nwi', and moping about there all the afternoon.\n\n'Well, some folks noticed that Andrey walked with rather wambling steps\nto church that morning; the truth o't was that his nearest neighbour's\nchild had been christened the day before, and Andrey, having stood\ngodfather, had stayed all night keeping up the christening, for he had\nsaid to himself, \"Not if I live to be thousand shall I again be made a\ngodfather one day, and a husband the next, and perhaps a father the next,\nand therefore I'll make the most of the blessing.\"  So that when he\nstarted from home in the morning he had not been in bed at all.  The\nresult was, as I say, that when he and his bride-to-he walked up the\nchurch to get married, the pa'son (who was a very strict man inside the\nchurch, whatever he was outside) looked hard at Andrey, and said, very\nsharp:\n\n'\"How's this, my man?  You are in liquor.  And so early, too.  I'm\nashamed of you!\"\n\n'\"Well, that's true, sir,\" says Andrey.  \"But I can walk straight enough\nfor practical purposes.  I can walk a chalk line,\" he says (meaning no\noffence), \"as well as some other folk: and--\" (getting hotter)--\"I reckon\nthat if you, Pa'son Billy Toogood, had kept up a christening all night so\nthoroughly as I have done, you wouldn't be able to stand at all; d--- me\nif you would!\"\n\n'This answer made Pa'son Billy--as they used to call him--rather spitish,\nnot to say hot, for he was a warm-tempered man if provoked, and he said,\nvery decidedly: \"Well, I cannot marry you in this state; and I will not!\nGo home and get sober!\"  And he slapped the book together like a\nrat-trap.\n\n'Then the bride burst out crying as if her heart would break, for very\nfear that she would lose Andrey after all her hard work to get him, and\nbegged and implored the pa'son to go on with the ceremony.  But no.\n\n'\"I won't be a party to your solemnizing matrimony with a tipsy man,\"\nsays Mr. Toogood.  \"It is not right and decent.  I am sorry for you, my\nyoung woman, but you'd better go home again.  I wonder how you could\nthink of bringing him here drunk like this!\"\n\n'\"But if--if he don't come drunk he won't come at all, sir!\" she says,\nthrough her sobs.\n\n'\"I can't help that,\" says the pa'son; and plead as she might, it did not\nmove him.  Then she tried him another way.\n\n'\"Well, then, if you'll go home, sir, and leave us here, and come back to\nthe church in an hour or two, I'll undertake to say that he shall be as\nsober as a judge,\" she cries.  \"We'll bide here, with your permission;\nfor if he once goes out of this here church unmarried, all Van Amburgh's\nhorses won't drag him back again!\"\n\n'\"Very well,\" says the parson.  \"I'll give you two hours, and then I'll\nreturn.\"\n\n'\"And please, sir, lock the door, so that we can't escape!\" says she.\n\n'\"Yes,\" says the parson.\n\n'\"And let nobody know that we are here.\"\n\n'The pa'son then took off his clane white surplice, and went away; and\nthe others consulted upon the best means for keeping the matter a secret,\nwhich it was not a very hard thing to do, the place being so lonely, and\nthe hour so early.  The witnesses, Andrey's brother and brother's wife,\nneither one o' which cared about Andrey's marrying Jane, and had come\nrather against their will, said they couldn't wait two hours in that hole\nof a place, wishing to get home to Longpuddle before dinner-time.  They\nwere altogether so crusty that the clerk said there was no difficulty in\ntheir doing as they wished.  They could go home as if their brother's\nwedding had actually taken place and the married couple had gone onward\nfor their day's pleasure jaunt to Port Bredy as intended, he, the clerk,\nand any casual passer-by would act as witnesses when the pa'son came\nback.\n\n'This was agreed to, and away Andrey's relations went, nothing loath, and\nthe clerk shut the church door and prepared to lock in the couple.  The\nbride went up and whispered to him, with her eyes a-streaming still.\n\n'\"My dear good clerk,\" she says, \"if we bide here in the church, folk may\nsee us through the winders, and find out what has happened; and 'twould\ncause such a talk and scandal that I never should get over it: and\nperhaps, too, dear Andrey might try to get out and leave me!  Will ye\nlock us up in the tower, my dear good clerk?\" she says.  \"I'll tole him\nin there if you will.\"\n\n'The clerk had no objection to do this to oblige the poor young woman,\nand they toled Andrey into the tower, and the clerk locked 'em both up\nstraightway, and then went home, to return at the end of the two hours.\n\n'Pa'son Toogood had not been long in his house after leaving the church\nwhen he saw a gentleman in pink and top-boots ride past his windows, and\nwith a sudden flash of heat he called to mind that the hounds met that\nday just on the edge of his parish.  The pa'son was one who dearly loved\nsport, and much he longed to be there.\n\n'In short, except o' Sundays and at tide-times in the week, Pa'son Billy\nwas the life o' the Hunt.  'Tis true that he was poor, and that he rode\nall of a heap, and that his black mare was rat-tailed and old, and his\ntops older, and all over of one colour, whitey-brown, and full o' cracks.\nBut he'd been in at the death of three thousand foxes.  And--being a\nbachelor man--every time he went to bed in summer he used to open the bed\nat bottom and crawl up head foremost, to mind 'em of the coming winter and\nthe good sport he'd have, and the foxes going to earth.  And whenever\nthere was a christening at the Squire's, and he had dinner there\nafterwards, as he always did, he never failed to christen the chiel over\nagain in a bottle of port wine.\n\n'Now the clerk was the parson's groom and gardener and jineral manager,\nand had just got back to his work in the garden when he, too, saw the\nhunting man pass, and presently saw lots more of 'em, noblemen and\ngentry, and then he saw the hounds, the huntsman, Jim Treadhedge, the\nwhipper-in, and I don't know who besides.  The clerk loved going to cover\nas frantical as the pa'son, so much so that whenever he saw or heard the\npack he could no more rule his feelings than if they were the winds of\nheaven.  He might be bedding, or he might be sowing--all was forgot.  So\nhe throws down his spade and rushes in to the pa'son, who was by this\ntime as frantical to go as he.\n\n'\"That there mare of yours, sir, do want exercise bad, very bad, this\nmorning!\" the clerk says, all of a tremble.  \"Don't ye think I'd better\ntrot her round the downs for an hour, sir?\"\n\n'\"To be sure, she does want exercise badly.  I'll trot her round myself,\"\nsays the parson.\n\n'\"Oh--you'll trot her yerself?  Well, there's the cob, sir.  Really that\ncob is getting oncontrollable through biding in a stable so long!  If you\nwouldn't mind my putting on the saddle--\"\n\n'\"Very well.  Take him out, certainly,\" says the pa'son, never caring\nwhat the clerk did so long as he himself could get off immediately.  So,\nscrambling into his riding-boots and breeches as quick as he could, he\nrode off towards the meet, intending to be back in an hour.  No sooner\nwas he gone than the clerk mounted the cob, and was off after him.  When\nthe pa'son got to the meet, he found a lot of friends, and was as jolly\nas he could be: the hounds found a'most as soon as they threw off, and\nthere was great excitement.  So, forgetting that he had meant to go back\nat once, away rides the pa'son with the rest o' the hunt, all across the\nfallow ground that lies between Lippet Wood and Green's Copse; and as he\ngalloped he looked behind for a moment, and there was the clerk close to\nhis heels.\n\n'\"Ha, ha, clerk--you here?\" he says.\n\n'\"Yes, sir, here be I,\" says t'other.\n\n'\"Fine exercise for the horses!\"\n\n'\"Ay, sir--hee, hee!\" says the clerk.\n\n'So they went on and on, into Green's Copse, then across to Higher\nJirton; then on across this very turnpike-road to Climmerston Ridge, then\naway towards Yalbury Wood: up hill and down dale, like the very wind, the\nclerk close to the pa'son, and the pa'son not far from the hounds.  Never\nwas there a finer run knowed with that pack than they had that day; and\nneither pa'son nor clerk thought one word about the unmarried couple\nlocked up in the church tower waiting to get j'ined.\n\n'\"These hosses of yours, sir, will be much improved by this!\" says the\nclerk as he rode along, just a neck behind the pa'son.  \"'Twas a happy\nthought of your reverent mind to bring 'em out to-day.  Why, it may be\nfrosty in a day or two, and then the poor things mid not be able to leave\nthe stable for weeks.\"\n\n'\"They may not, they may not, it is true.  A merciful man is merciful to\nhis beast,\" says the pa'son.\n\n'\"Hee, hee!\" says the clerk, glancing sly into the pa'son's eye.\n\n'\"Ha, ha!\" says the pa'son, a-glancing back into the clerk's.  \"Halloo!\"\nhe shouts, as he sees the fox break cover at that moment.\n\n'\"Halloo!\" cries the clerk.  \"There he goes!  Why, dammy, there's two\nfoxes--\"\n\n'\"Hush, clerk, hush!  Don't let me hear that word again!  Remember our\ncalling.\"\n\n'\"True, sir, true.  But really, good sport do carry away a man so, that\nhe's apt to forget his high persuasion!\"  And the next minute the corner\nof the clerk's eye shot again into the corner of the pa'son's, and the\npa'son's back again to the clerk's.  \"Hee, hee!\" said the clerk.\n\n'\"Ha, ha!\" said Pa'son Toogood.\n\n'\"Ah, sir,\" says the clerk again, \"this is better than crying Amen to\nyour Ever-and-ever on a winter's morning!\"\n\n'\"Yes, indeed, clerk!  To everything there's a season,\" says Pa'son\nToogood, quite pat, for he was a learned Christian man when he liked, and\nhad chapter and ve'se at his tongue's end, as a pa'son should.\n\n'At last, late in the day, the hunting came to an end by the fox running\ninto a' old woman's cottage, under her table, and up the clock-case.  The\npa'son and clerk were among the first in at the death, their faces\na-staring in at the old woman's winder, and the clock striking as he'd\nnever been heard to strik' before.  Then came the question of finding\ntheir way home.\n\n'Neither the pa'son nor the clerk knowed how they were going to do this,\nfor their beasts were wellnigh tired down to the ground.  But they\nstarted back-along as well as they could, though they were so done up\nthat they could only drag along at a' amble, and not much of that at a\ntime.\n\n'\"We shall never, never get there!\" groaned Mr. Toogood, quite bowed\ndown.\n\n'\"Never!\" groans the clerk.  \"'Tis a judgment upon us for our\niniquities!\"\n\n'\"I fear it is,\" murmurs the pa'son.\n\n'Well, 'twas quite dark afore they entered the pa'sonage gate, having\ncrept into the parish as quiet as if they'd stole a hammer, little\nwishing their congregation to know what they'd been up to all day long.\nAnd as they were so dog-tired, and so anxious about the horses, never\nonce did they think of the unmarried couple.  As soon as ever the horses\nhad been stabled and fed, and the pa'son and clerk had had a bit and a\nsup theirselves, they went to bed.\n\n'Next morning when Pa'son Toogood was at breakfast, thinking of the\nglorious sport he'd had the day before, the clerk came in a hurry to the\ndoor and asked to see him.\n\n'\"It has just come into my mind, sir, that we've forgot all about the\ncouple that we was to have married yesterday!\"\n\n'The half-chawed victuals dropped from the pa'son's mouth as if he'd been\nshot.  \"Bless my soul,\" says he, \"so we have!  How very awkward!\"\n\n'\"It is, sir; very.  Perhaps we've ruined the 'ooman!\"\n\n'\"Ah--to be sure--I remember!  She ought to have been married before.\"\n\n'\"If anything has happened to her up in that there tower, and no doctor\nor nuss--\"\n\n('Ah--poor thing!' sighed the women.)\n\n'\"--'twill be a quarter-sessions matter for us, not to speak of the\ndisgrace to the Church!\"\n\n'\"Good God, clerk, don't drive me wild!\" says the pa'son.  \"Why the hell\ndidn't I marry 'em, drunk or sober!\"  (Pa'sons used to cuss in them days\nlike plain honest men.)  \"Have you been to the church to see what\nhappened to them, or inquired in the village?\"\n\n'\"Not I, sir!  It only came into my head a moment ago, and I always like\nto be second to you in church matters.  You could have knocked me down\nwith a sparrer's feather when I thought o't, sir; I assure 'ee you\ncould!\"\n\n'Well, the parson jumped up from his breakfast, and together they went\noff to the church.\n\n'\"It is not at all likely that they are there now,\" says Mr. Toogood, as\nthey went; \"and indeed I hope they are not.  They be pretty sure to have\n'scaped and gone home.\"\n\n'However, they opened the church-hatch, entered the churchyard, and\nlooking up at the tower, there they seed a little small white face at the\nbelfry-winder, and a little small hand waving.  'Twas the bride.\n\n'\"God my life, clerk,\" says Mr. Toogood, \"I don't know how to face 'em!\"\nAnd he sank down upon a tombstone.  \"How I wish I hadn't been so cussed\nparticular!\"\n\n'\"Yes--'twas a pity we didn't finish it when we'd begun,\" the clerk said.\n\"Still, since the feelings of your holy priestcraft wouldn't let ye, the\ncouple must put up with it.\"\n\n'\"True, clerk, true!  Does she look as if anything premature had took\nplace?\"\n\n'\"I can't see her no lower down than her arm-pits, sir.\"\n\n'\"Well--how do her face look?\"\n\n'\"It do look mighty white!\"\n\n'\"Well, we must know the worst!  Dear me, how the small of my back do\nache from that ride yesterday! . . . But to more godly business!\"\n\n'They went on into the church, and unlocked the tower stairs, and\nimmediately poor Jane and Andrey busted out like starved mice from a\ncupboard, Andrey limp and sober enough now, and his bride pale and cold,\nbut otherwise as usual.\n\n'\"What,\" says the pa'son, with a great breath of relief, \"you haven't\nbeen here ever since?\"\n\n'\"Yes, we have, sir!\" says the bride, sinking down upon a seat in her\nweakness.  \"Not a morsel, wet or dry, have we had since!  It was\nimpossible to get out without help, and here we've stayed!\"\n\n'\"But why didn't you shout, good souls?\" said the pa'son.\n\n'\"She wouldn't let me,\" says Andrey.\n\n'\"Because we were so ashamed at what had led to it,\" sobs Jane.  \"We felt\nthat if it were noised abroad it would cling to us all our lives!  Once\nor twice Andrey had a good mind to toll the bell, but then he said: \"No;\nI'll starve first.  I won't bring disgrace on my name and yours, my\ndear.\"  And so we waited and waited, and walked round and round; but\nnever did you come till now!\"\n\n'\"To my regret!\" says the parson.  \"Now, then, we will soon get it over.\"\n\n'\"I--I should like some victuals,\" said Andrey, \"'twould gie me courage\nif it is only a crust o' bread and a' onion; for I am that leery that I\ncan feel my stomach rubbing against my backbone.\"\n\n'\"I think we had better get it done,\" said the bride, a bit anxious in\nmanner; \"since we are all here convenient, too!\"\n\n'Andrey gave way about the victuals, and the clerk called in a second\nwitness who wouldn't be likely to gossip about it, and soon the knot was\ntied, and the bride looked smiling and calm forthwith, and Andrey limper\nthan ever.\n\n'\"Now,\" said Pa'son Toogood, \"you two must come to my house, and have a\ngood lining put to your insides before you go a step further.\"\n\n'They were very glad of the offer, and went out of the churchyard by one\npath while the pa'son and clerk went out by the other, and so did not\nattract notice, it being still early.  They entered the rectory as if\nthey'd just come back from their trip to Port Bredy; and then they\nknocked in the victuals and drink till they could hold no more.\n\n'It was a long while before the story of what they had gone through was\nknown, but it was talked of in time, and they themselves laugh over it\nnow; though what Jane got for her pains was no great bargain after all.\n'Tis true she saved her name.'\n\n* * * * *\n\n'Was that the same Andrey who went to the squire's house as one of the\nChristmas fiddlers?' asked the seedsman.\n\n'No, no,' replied Mr. Profitt, the schoolmaster.  'It was his father did\nthat.  Ay, it was all owing to his being such a man for eating and\ndrinking.'  Finding that he had the ear of the audience, the schoolmaster\ncontinued without delay:--\n\n\n\nOLD ANDREY'S EXPERIENCE AS A MUSICIAN\n\n\n'I was one of the choir-boys at that time, and we and the players were to\nappear at the manor-house as usual that Christmas week, to play and sing\nin the hall to the squire's people and visitors (among 'em being the\narchdeacon, Lord and Lady Baxby, and I don't know who); afterwards going,\nas we always did, to have a good supper in the servants' hall.  Andrew\nknew this was the custom, and meeting us when we were starting to go, he\nsaid to us: \"Lord, how I should like to join in that meal of beef, and\nturkey, and plum-pudding, and ale, that you happy ones be going to just\nnow!  One more or less will make no difference to the squire.  I am too\nold to pass as a singing boy, and too bearded to pass as a singing girl;\ncan ye lend me a fiddle, neighbours, that I may come with ye as a\nbandsman?\"\n\n'Well, we didn't like to be hard upon him, and lent him an old one,\nthough Andrew knew no more of music than the Cerne Giant; and armed with\nthe instrument he walked up to the squire's house with the others of us\nat the time appointed, and went in boldly, his fiddle under his arm.  He\nmade himself as natural as he could in opening the music-books and moving\nthe candles to the best points for throwing light upon the notes; and all\nwent well till we had played and sung \"While shepherds watch,\" and \"Star,\narise,\" and \"Hark the glad sound.\"  Then the squire's mother, a tall\ngruff old lady, who was much interested in church-music, said quite\nunexpectedly to Andrew: \"My man, I see you don't play your instrument\nwith the rest.  How is that?\"\n\n'Every one of the choir was ready to sink into the earth with concern at\nthe fix Andrew was in.  We could see that he had fallen into a cold\nsweat, and how he would get out of it we did not know.\n\n'\"I've had a misfortune, mem,\" he says, bowing as meek as a child.\n\"Coming along the road I fell down and broke my bow.\"\n\n'\"Oh, I am sorry to hear that,\" says she.  \"Can't it be mended?\"\n\n'\"Oh no, mem,\" says Andrew.  \"'Twas broke all to splinters.\"\n\n'\"I'll see what I can do for you,\" says she.\n\n'And then it seemed all over, and we played \"Rejoice, ye drowsy mortals\nall,\" in D and two sharps.  But no sooner had we got through it than she\nsays to Andrew,\n\n'\"I've sent up into the attic, where we have some old musical\ninstruments, and found a bow for you.\"  And she hands the bow to poor\nwretched Andrew, who didn't even know which end to take hold of.  \"Now we\nshall have the full accompaniment,\" says she.\n\n'Andrew's face looked as if it were made of rotten apple as he stood in\nthe circle of players in front of his book; for if there was one person\nin the parish that everybody was afraid of, 'twas this hook-nosed old\nlady.  However, by keeping a little behind the next man he managed to\nmake pretence of beginning, sawing away with his bow without letting it\ntouch the strings, so that it looked as if he were driving into the tune\nwith heart and soul.  'Tis a question if he wouldn't have got through all\nright if one of the squire's visitors (no other than the archdeacon)\nhadn't noticed that he held the fiddle upside down, the nut under his\nchin, and the tail-piece in his hand; and they began to crowd round him,\nthinking 'twas some new way of performing.\n\n'This revealed everything; the squire's mother had Andrew turned out of\nthe house as a vile impostor, and there was great interruption to the\nharmony of the proceedings, the squire declaring he should have notice to\nleave his cottage that day fortnight.  However, when we got to the\nservants' hall there sat Andrew, who had been let in at the back door by\nthe orders of the squire's wife, after being turned out at the front by\nthe orders of the squire, and nothing more was heard about his leaving\nhis cottage.  But Andrew never performed in public as a musician after\nthat night; and now he's dead and gone, poor man, as we all shall be!'\n\n* * * * *\n\n'I had quite forgotten the old choir, with their fiddles and bass-viols,'\nsaid the home-comer, musingly.  'Are they still going on the same as of\nold?'\n\n'Bless the man!' said Christopher Twink, the master-thatcher; 'why,\nthey've been done away with these twenty year.  A young teetotaler plays\nthe organ in church now, and plays it very well; though 'tis not quite\nsuch good music as in old times, because the organ is one of them that go\nwith a winch, and the young teetotaler says he can't always throw the\nproper feeling into the tune without wellnigh working his arms off.'\n\n'Why did they make the change, then?'\n\n'Well, partly because of fashion, partly because the old musicians got\ninto a sort of scrape.  A terrible scrape 'twas too--wasn't it, John?  I\nshall never forget it--never!  They lost their character as officers of\nthe church as complete as if they'd never had any character at all.'\n\n'That was very bad for them.'\n\n'Yes.'  The master-thatcher attentively regarded past times as if they\nlay about a mile off, and went on:--\n\n","HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy\nPrince.  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes\nhe had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his\nsword-hilt.\n\nHe was very much admired indeed.  “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,”\nremarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for\nhaving artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing\nlest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\n\n“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible mother of her\nlittle boy who was crying for the moon.  “The Happy Prince never dreams\nof crying for anything.”\n\n“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a\ndisappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\n\n“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out\nof the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white\npinafores.\n\n“How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen\none.”\n\n“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the\nMathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not\napprove of children dreaming.\n\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had\ngone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was\nin love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring\nas he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so\nattracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\n\n“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at\nonce, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her,\ntouching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was\nhis courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\n“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has\nno money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite\nfull of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.\n\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.\n“She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a\ncoquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.”  And certainly,\nwhenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  “I\nadmit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my\nwife, consequently, should love travelling also.”\n\n“Will you come away with me?” he said finally to her; but the Reed shook\nher head, she was so attached to her home.\n\n“You have been trifling with me,” he cried.  “I am off to the Pyramids.\nGood-bye!” and he flew away.\n\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  “Where\nshall I put up?” he said; “I hope the town has made preparations.”\n\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\n\n“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of\nfresh air.”  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\n\n“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round,\nand he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under\nhis wing a large drop of water fell on him.  “What a curious thing!” he\ncried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear\nand bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is\nreally dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her\nselfishness.”\n\nThen another drop fell.\n\n“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he said; “I\nmust look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.\n\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up,\nand saw—Ah! what did he see?\n\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were\nrunning down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the\nmoonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\n\n“Who are you?” he said.\n\n“I am the Happy Prince.”\n\n“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched\nme.”\n\n“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not\nknow what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where\nsorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my\ncompanions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great\nHall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask\nwhat lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers\ncalled me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be\nhappiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have\nset me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery\nof my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but\nweep.”\n\n“What! is he not solid gold?” said the Swallow to himself.  He was too\npolite to make any personal remarks out loud.\n\n“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a\nlittle street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and\nthrough it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and\nworn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she\nis a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for\nthe loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next\nCourt-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying\nill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing\nto give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little\nSwallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet\nare fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow.  “My friends are flying up\nand down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they\nwill go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there\nhimself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and\nembalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and\nhis hands are like withered leaves.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and\nthe mother so sad.”\n\n“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow.  “Last summer, when I\nwas staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons,\nwho were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we\nswallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family\nfamous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.”\n\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.\n“It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one night,\nand be your messenger.”\n\n“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.\n\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and\nflew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\n\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were\nsculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A\nbeautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  “How wonderful\nthe stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the power of love!”\n\n“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she answered;\n“I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the\nseamstresses are so lazy.”\n\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of\nthe ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining\nwith each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he\ncame to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on\nhis bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he\nhopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble.\nThen he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his\nwings.  “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and\nhe sank into a delicious slumber.\n\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had\ndone.  “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although\nit is so cold.”\n\n“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince.  And the\nlittle Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always\nmade him sleepy.\n\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  “What a\nremarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was\npassing over the bridge.  “A swallow in winter!”  And he wrote a long\nletter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full\nof so many words that they could not understand.\n\n“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at\nthe prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time\non top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped,\nand said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so he enjoyed\nhimself very much.\n\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  “Have you any\ncommissions for Egypt?” he cried; “I am just starting.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow.  “To-morrow my friends\nwill fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among\nthe bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All\nnight long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he\nutters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions\ncome down to the water’s edge to drink.  They have eyes like green\nberyls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the\ncity I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered\nwith papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered\nviolets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a\npomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a\nplay for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any\nmore.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.”\n\n“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really had\na good heart.  “Shall I take him another ruby?”\n\n“Alas!  I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I\nhave left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of\nIndia a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.\nHe will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish\nhis play.”\n\n“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to\nweep.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the\nstudent’s garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in\nthe roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man\nhad his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the\nbird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying\non the withered violets.\n\n“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some great\nadmirer.  Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.\n\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of\na large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold\nwith ropes.  “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up.  “I am\ngoing to Egypt”! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon\nrose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n\n“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be\nhere.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the\ncrocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are\nbuilding a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves\nare watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave\nyou, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back\ntwo beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby\nshall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the\ngreat sea.”\n\n“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little\nmatch-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all\nspoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money,\nand she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is\nbare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will\nnot beat her.”\n\n“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot\npluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it.  He\nswooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her\nhand.  “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran\nhome, laughing.\n\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince.  “You are blind now,” he said,\n“so I will stay with you always.”\n\n“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt.”\n\n“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the\nPrince’s feet.\n\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of\nwhat he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who\nstand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their\nbeaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the\ndesert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the\nside of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King\nof the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a\nlarge crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and\nhas twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who\nsail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the\nbutterflies.\n\n“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous\nthings, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of\nwomen.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little\nSwallow, and tell me what you see there.”\n\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in\ntheir beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He\nflew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children\nlooking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a\nbridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep\nthemselves warm.  “How hungry we are!” they said.  “You must not lie\nhere,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\n\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\n\n“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off,\nleaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold\ncan make them happy.”\n\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy\nPrince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he\nbrought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier, and they\nlaughed and played games in the street.  “We have bread now!” they cried.\n\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets\nlooked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and\nglistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of\nthe houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore\nscarlet caps and skated on the ice.\n\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave\nthe Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the\nbaker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself\nwarm by flapping his wings.\n\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to\nfly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more.  “Good-bye, dear Prince!” he\nmurmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?”\n\n“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the\nPrince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips,\nfor I love you.”\n\n“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow.  “I am going to\nthe House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?”\n\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his\nfeet.\n\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something\nhad broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.\nIt certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\n\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in\ncompany with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked\nup at the statue: “Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!” he said.\n\n“How shabby indeed!” cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with\nthe Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\n\n“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is\ngolden no longer,” said the Mayor in fact, “he is litttle better than a\nbeggar!”\n\n“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors.\n\n“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!” continued the Mayor.  “We\nmust really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die\nhere.”  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\n\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  “As he is no longer\nbeautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the\nUniversity.\n\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of\nthe Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  “We must\nhave another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a statue of\nmyself.”\n\n“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.\nWhen I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.\n\n“What a strange thing!” said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.\n“This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it\naway.”  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also\nlying.\n\n“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to one of\nHis Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\n\n“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of Paradise this\nlittle bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy\nPrince shall praise me.”\n\n","Article 1401: Scope and Coverage\n1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) financial institutions of another Party;\n(b) investors of another Party, and investments of such investors, in financial institutions in the Party's territory; and\n(c) cross-border trade in financial services.\n2.

Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party, including its public entities, from exclusively conducting or providing in its territory:\n\n(a) activities or services forming part of a public retirement plan or statutory system of social security; or\n(b) activities or services for the account or with the guarantee or using the financial resources of the Party, including its public entities.\n4. Annex 1401.4 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex.\nArticle 1402: Self-Regulatory Organizations\nWhere a Party requires a financial institution or a cross-border financial service provider of another Party to be a member of, participate in, or have access to, a selfregulatory organization to provide a financial service in or into the territory of that Party, the Party shall ensure observance of the obligations of this Chapter by such selfregulatory organization.\nArticle 1403: Establishment of Financial Institutions\n1. The Parties recognize the principle that an investor of another Party should be permitted to establish a financial institution in the territory of a Party in the juridical form chosen by such investor.\n2. The Parties also recognize the principle that an investor of another Party should be permitted to participate widely in a Party's market through the ability of such investor to:\n\n(a) provide in that Party's territory a range of financial services through separate financial institutions as may be required by that Party;\n(b) expand geographically in that Party's territory; and\n(c) own financial institutions in that Party's territory without being subject to ownership requirements specific to foreign financial institutions.\n3. Subject to Annex 1403.3, at such time as the United States permits commercial banks of another Party located in its territory to expand through subsidiaries or direct branches into substantially all of the United States market, the Parties shall review and assess market access provided by each Party in relation to the principles in paragraphs 1 and 2 with a view to adopting arrangements permitting investors of another Party to choose the juridical form of establishment of commercial banks.\n4. Each Party shall permit an investor of another Party that does not own or control a financial institution in the Party's territory to establish a financial institution in that territory. A Party may:\n\n(a) require an investor of another Party to incorporate under the Party's law any financial institution it establishes in the Party's territory; or\n(b) impose terms and conditions on establishment that are consistent with Article 1405.\n5. For purposes of this Article, \"investor of another Party\" means an investor of another Party engaged in the business of providing financial services in the territory of that Party.\nArticle 1404: Cross-Border Trade\n1. No Party may adopt any measure restricting any type of cross-border trade in financial services by cross-border financial service providers of another Party that the Party permits on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, except to the extent set out in Section B of the Party's Schedule to Annex VII.\n2. Each Party shall permit persons located in its territory, and its nationals wherever located, to purchase financial services from cross-border financial service providers of another Party located in the territory of that other Party or of another Party. This obligation does not require a Party to permit such providers to do business or solicit in its territory. Subject to paragraph 1, each Party may define \"doing business\" and \"solicitation\" for purposes of this obligation.\n3. Without prejudice to other means of prudential regulation of cross-border trade in financial services, a Party may require the registration of cross-border financial service providers of another Party and of financial instruments.\n4. The Parties shall consult on future liberalization of cross-border trade in financial services as set out in Annex 1404.4.\nArticle 1405: National Treatment\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own investors, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments in financial institutions in its territory.\n2. Each Party shall accord to financial institutions of another Party and to investments of investors of another Party in financial institutions treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial institutions and to investments of its own investors in financial institutions, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments.\n3. Subject to Article 1404, where a Party permits the cross-border provision of a financial service it shall accord to the cross-border financial service providers of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial service providers, in like circumstances, with respect to the provision of such service.\n4. The treatment that a Party is required to accord under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 means, with respect to a measure of any state or province:\n\n(a) in the case of an investor of another Party with an investment in a financial institution, an investment of such investor in a financial institution, or a financial institution of such investor, located in a state or province, treatment no less favorable than the treatment accorded to an investor of the Party in a financial institution, an investment of such investor in a financial institution, or a financial institution of such investor, located in that state or province, in like circumstances; and\n(b) in any other case, treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded to an investor of the Party in a financial institution, its financial institution or its investment in a financial institution, in like circumstances.\nFor greater certainty, in the case of an investor of another Party with investments in financial institutions or financial institutions of such investor, located in more than one state or province, the treatment required under subparagraph (a) means:\n\n(c) treatment of the investor that is no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded to an investor of the Party with an investment located in such states, or provinces in like circumstances; and\n(d) with respect to an investment of the investor in a financial institution or a financial institution of such investor, located in a state or province, treatment no less favorable than that accorded to an investment of an investor of the Party, or a financial institution of such investor, located in that state or province, in like circumstances.\n5. A Party's treatment of financial institutions and cross-border financial service providers of another Party, whether different or identical to that accorded to its own institutions or providers in like circumstances, is consistent with paragraphs 1 through 3 if the treatment affords equal competitive opportunities.\n6. A Party's treatment affords equal competitive opportunities if it does not disadvantage financial institutions and cross-border financial services providers of another Party in their ability to provide financial services as compared with the ability of the Party's own financial institutions and financial services providers to provide such services, in like circumstances.\n7. Differences in market share, profitability or size do not in themselves establish a denial of equal competitive opportunities, but such differences may be used as evidence regarding whether a Party's treatment affords equal competitive opportunities.\nArticle 1406: Most-Favored-Nation Treatment\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, financial institutions of another Party, investments of investors in financial institutions and cross-border financial service providers of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to the investors, financial institutions, investments of investors in financial institutions and cross-border financial service providers of any other Party or of a non-Party, in like circumstances.\n2.

I can download at home already le. =D","'I shall never forget Tony's face.  'Twas a little, round, firm, tight\nface, with a seam here and there left by the smallpox, but not enough to\nhurt his looks in a woman's eye, though he'd had it badish when he was a\nboy.  So very serious looking and unsmiling 'a was, that young man, that\nit really seemed as if he couldn't laugh at all without great pain to his\nconscience.  He looked very hard at a small speck in your eye when\ntalking to 'ee.  And there was no more sign of a whisker or beard on Tony\nKytes's face than on the palm of my hand.  He used to sing \"The Tailor's\nBreeches\" with a religious manner, as if it were a hymn:--\n\n'\"O the petticoats went off, and the breeches they went on!\"\n\nand all the rest of the scandalous stuff.  He was quite the women's\nfavourite, and in return for their likings he loved 'em in shoals.\n\n'But in course of time Tony got fixed down to one in particular, Milly\nRichards, a nice, light, small, tender little thing; and it was soon said\nthat they were engaged to be married.  One Saturday he had been to market\nto do business for his father, and was driving home the waggon in the\nafternoon.  When he reached the foot of the very hill we shall be going\nover in ten minutes who should he see waiting for him at the top but\nUnity Sallet, a handsome girl, one of the young women he'd been very\ntender toward before he'd got engaged to Milly.\n\n'As soon as Tony came up to her she said, \"My dear Tony, will you give me\na lift home?\"\n\n'\"That I will, darling,\" said Tony.  \"You don't suppose I could refuse\n'ee?\"\n\n'She smiled a smile, and up she hopped, and on drove Tony.\n\n'\"Tony,\" she says, in a sort of tender chide, \"why did ye desert me for\nthat other one?  In what is she better than I?  I should have made 'ee a\nfiner wife, and a more loving one too.  'Tisn't girls that are so easily\nwon at first that are the best.  Think how long we've known each\nother--ever since we were children almost--now haven't we, Tony?\"\n\n'\"Yes, that we have,\" says Tony, a-struck with the truth o't.\n\n'\"And you've never seen anything in me to complain of, have ye, Tony?  Now\ntell the truth to me?\"\n\n'\"I never have, upon my life,\" says Tony.\n\n'\"And--can you say I'm not pretty, Tony?  Now look at me!\"\n\n'He let his eyes light upon her for a long while.  \"I really can't,\" says\nhe.  \"In fact, I never knowed you was so pretty before!\"\n\n'\"Prettier than she?\"\n\n'What Tony would have said to that nobody knows, for before he could\nspeak, what should he see ahead, over the hedge past the turning, but a\nfeather he knew well--the feather in Milly's hat--she to whom he had been\nthinking of putting the question as to giving out the banns that very\nweek.\n\n'\"Unity,\" says he, as mild as he could, \"here's Milly coming.  Now I\nshall catch it mightily if she sees 'ee riding here with me; and if you\nget down she'll be turning the corner in a moment, and, seeing 'ee in the\nroad, she'll know we've been coming on together.  Now, dearest Unity,\nwill ye, to avoid all unpleasantness, which I know ye can't bear any more\nthan I, will ye lie down in the back part of the waggon, and let me cover\nyou over with the tarpaulin till Milly has passed?  It will all be done\nin a minute.  Do!--and I'll think over what we've said; and perhaps I\nshall put a loving question to you after all, instead of to Milly.\n'Tisn't true that it is all settled between her and me.\"\n\n'Well, Unity Sallet agreed, and lay down at the back end of the waggon,\nand Tony covered her over, so that the waggon seemed to be empty but for\nthe loose tarpaulin; and then he drove on to meet Milly.\n\n'\"My dear Tony!\" cries Milly, looking up with a little pout at him as he\ncame near.  \"How long you've been coming home!  Just as if I didn't live\nat Upper Longpuddle at all!  And I've come to meet you as you asked me to\ndo, and to ride back with you, and talk over our future home--since you\nasked me, and I promised.  But I shouldn't have come else, Mr. Tony!\"\n\n'\"Ay, my dear, I did ask ye--to be sure I did, now I think of it--but I\nhad quite forgot it.  To ride back with me, did you say, dear Milly?\"\n\n'\"Well, of course!  What can I do else?  Surely you don't want me to\nwalk, now I've come all this way?\"\n\n'\"O no, no!  I was thinking you might be going on to town to meet your\nmother.  I saw her there--and she looked as if she might be expecting\n'ee.\"\n\n'\"O no; she's just home.  She came across the fields, and so got back\nbefore you.\"\n\n'\"Ah!  I didn't know that,\" says Tony.  And there was no help for it but\nto take her up beside him.\n\n'They talked on very pleasantly, and looked at the trees, and beasts, and\nbirds, and insects, and at the ploughmen at work in the fields, till\npresently who should they see looking out of the upper window of a house\nthat stood beside the road they were following, but Hannah Jolliver,\nanother young beauty of the place at that time, and the very first woman\nthat Tony had fallen in love with--before Milly and before Unity, in\nfact--the one that he had almost arranged to marry instead of Milly.  She\nwas a much more dashing girl than Milly Richards, though he'd not thought\nmuch of her of late.  The house Hannah was looking from was her aunt's.\n\n'\"My dear Milly--my coming wife, as I may call 'ee,\" says Tony in his\nmodest way, and not so loud that Unity could overhear, \"I see a young\nwoman alooking out of window, who I think may accost me.  The fact is,\nMilly, she had a notion that I was wishing to marry her, and since she's\ndiscovered I've promised another, and a prettier than she, I'm rather\nafeard of her temper if she sees us together.  Now, Milly, would you do\nme a favour--my coming wife, as I may say?\"\n\n'\"Certainly, dearest Tony,\" says she.\n\n'\"Then would ye creep under the empty sacks just here in the front of the\nwaggon, and hide there out of sight till we've passed the house?  She\nhasn't seen us yet.  You see, we ought to live in peace and good-will\nsince 'tis almost Christmas, and 'twill prevent angry passions rising,\nwhich we always should do.\"\n\n'\"I don't mind, to oblige you, Tony,\" Milly said; and though she didn't\ncare much about doing it, she crept under, and crouched down just behind\nthe seat, Unity being snug at the other end.  So they drove on till they\ngot near the road-side cottage.  Hannah had soon seen him coming, and\nwaited at the window, looking down upon him.  She tossed her head a\nlittle disdainful and smiled off-hand.\n\n'\"Well, aren't you going to be civil enough to ask me to ride home with\nyou!\" she says, seeing that he was for driving past with a nod and a\nsmile.\n\n'\"Ah, to be sure!  What was I thinking of?\" said Tony, in a flutter.  \"But\nyou seem as if you was staying at your aunt's?\"\n\n'\"No, I am not,\" she said.  \"Don't you see I have my bonnet and jacket\non?  I have only called to see her on my way home.  How can you be so\nstupid, Tony?\"\n\n'\"In that case--ah--of course you must come along wi' me,\" says Tony,\nfeeling a dim sort of sweat rising up inside his clothes.  And he reined\nin the horse, and waited till she'd come downstairs, and then helped her\nup beside him.  He drove on again, his face as long as a face that was a\nround one by nature well could be.\n\n'Hannah looked round sideways into his eyes.  \"This is nice, isn't it,\nTony?\" she says.  \"I like riding with you.\"\n\n'Tony looked back into her eyes.  \"And I with you,\" he said after a\nwhile.  In short, having considered her, he warmed up, and the more he\nlooked at her the more he liked her, till he couldn't for the life of him\nthink why he had ever said a word about marriage to Milly or Unity while\nHannah Jolliver was in question.  So they sat a little closer and closer,\ntheir feet upon the foot-board and their shoulders touching, and Tony\nthought over and over again how handsome Hannah was.  He spoke tenderer\nand tenderer, and called her \"dear Hannah\" in a whisper at last.\n\n'\"You've settled it with Milly by this time, I suppose,\" said she.\n\n'\"N-no, not exactly.\"\n\n'\"What?  How low you talk, Tony.\"\n\n'\"Yes--I've a kind of hoarseness.  I said, not exactly.\"\n\n'\"I suppose you mean to?\"\n\n'\"Well, as to that--\"  His eyes rested on her face, and hers on his.  He\nwondered how he could have been such a fool as not to follow up Hannah.\n\"My sweet Hannah!\" he bursts out, taking her hand, not being really able\nto help it, and forgetting Milly and Unity, and all the world besides.\n\"Settled it?  I don't think I have!\"\n\n'\"Hark!\" says Hannah.\n\n'\"What?\" says Tony, letting go her hand.\n\n'\"Surely I heard a sort of little screaming squeak under those sacks?\nWhy, you've been carrying corn, and there's mice in this waggon, I\ndeclare!\"  She began to haul up the tails of her gown.\n\n'\"Oh no; 'tis the axle,\" said Tony in an assuring way.  \"It do go like\nthat sometimes in dry weather.\"\n\n'\"Perhaps it was . . . Well, now, to be quite honest, dear Tony, do you\nlike her better than me?  Because--because, although I've held off so\nindependent, I'll own at last that I do like 'ee, Tony, to tell the\ntruth; and I wouldn't say no if you asked me--you know what.\"\n\n'Tony was so won over by this pretty offering mood of a girl who had been\nquite the reverse (Hannah had a backward way with her at times, if you\ncan mind) that he just glanced behind, and then whispered very soft, \"I\nhaven't quite promised her, and I think I can get out of it, and ask you\nthat question you speak of.\"\n\n'\"Throw over Milly?--all to marry me!  How delightful!\" broke out Hannah,\nquite loud, clapping her hands.\n\n'At this there was a real squeak--an angry, spiteful squeak, and\nafterward a long moan, as if something had broke its heart, and a\nmovement of the empty sacks.\n\n'\"Something's there!\" said Hannah, starting up.\n\n'\"It's nothing, really,\" says Tony in a soothing voice, and praying\ninwardly for a way out of this.  \"I wouldn't tell 'ee at first, because I\nwouldn't frighten 'ee.  But, Hannah, I've really a couple of ferrets in a\nbag under there, for rabbiting, and they quarrel sometimes.  I don't wish\nit knowed, as 'twould be called poaching.  Oh, they can't get out, bless\nye--you are quite safe!  And--and--what a fine day it is, isn't it,\nHannah, for this time of year?  Be you going to market next Saturday?  How\nis your aunt now?\"  And so on, says Tony, to keep her from talking any\nmore about love in Milly's hearing.\n\n'But he found his work cut out for him, and wondering again how he should\nget out of this ticklish business, he looked about for a chance.  Nearing\nhome he saw his father in a field not far off, holding up his hand as if\nhe wished to speak to Tony.\n\n'\"Would you mind taking the reins a moment, Hannah,\" he said, much\nrelieved, \"while I go and find out what father wants?\"\n\n'She consented, and away he hastened into the field, only too glad to get\nbreathing time.  He found that his father was looking at him with rather\na stern eye.\n\n'\"Come, come, Tony,\" says old Mr. Kytes, as soon as his son was alongside\nhim, \"this won't do, you know.\"\n\n'\"What?\" says Tony.\n\n'\"Why, if you mean to marry Milly Richards, do it, and there's an end\no't.  But don't go driving about the country with Jolliver's daughter and\nmaking a scandal.  I won't have such things done.\"\n\n'\"I only asked her--that is, she asked me, to ride home.\"\n\n'\"She?  Why, now, if it had been Milly, 'twould have been quite proper;\nbut you and Hannah Jolliver going about by yourselves--\"\n\n'\"Milly's there too, father.\"\n\n'\"Milly?  Where?\"\n\n'\"Under the corn-sacks!  Yes, the truth is, father, I've got rather into\na nunny-watch, I'm afeard!  Unity Sallet is there too--yes, at the other\nend, under the tarpaulin.  All three are in that waggon, and what to do\nwith 'em I know no more than the dead!  The best plan is, as I'm\nthinking, to speak out loud and plain to one of 'em before the rest, and\nthat will settle it; not but what 'twill cause 'em to kick up a bit of a\nmiff, for certain.  Now which would you marry, father, if you was in my\nplace?\"\n\n'\"Whichever of 'em did _not_ ask to ride with thee.\"\n\n'\"That was Milly, I'm bound to say, as she only mounted by my invitation.\nBut Milly--\"\n\n\"Then stick to Milly, she's the best . . . But look at that!\"\n\n'His father pointed toward the waggon.  \"She can't hold that horse in.\nYou shouldn't have left the reins in her hands.  Run on and take the\nhorse's head, or there'll be some accident to them maids!\"\n\n'Tony's horse, in fact, in spite of Hannah's tugging at the reins, had\nstarted on his way at a brisk walking pace, being very anxious to get\nback to the stable, for he had had a long day out.  Without another word\nTony rushed away from his father to overtake the horse.\n\n'Now of all things that could have happened to wean him from Milly there\nwas nothing so powerful as his father's recommending her.  No; it could\nnot be Milly, after all.  Hannah must be the one, since he could not\nmarry all three.  This he thought while running after the waggon.  But\nqueer things were happening inside it.\n\n'It was, of course, Milly who had screamed under the sack-bags, being\nobliged to let off her bitter rage and shame in that way at what Tony was\nsaying, and never daring to show, for very pride and dread o' being\nlaughed at, that she was in hiding.  She became more and more restless,\nand in twisting herself about, what did she see but another woman's foot\nand white stocking close to her head.  It quite frightened her, not\nknowing that Unity Sallet was in the waggon likewise.  But after the\nfright was over she determined to get to the bottom of all this, and she\ncrept and crept along the bed of the waggon, under the tarpaulin, like a\nsnake, when lo and behold she came face to face with Unity.\n\n'\"Well, if this isn't disgraceful!\" says Milly in a raging whisper to\nUnity.\n\n'\"'Tis,\" says Unity, \"to see you hiding in a young man's waggon like\nthis, and no great character belonging to either of ye!\"\n\n'\"Mind what you are saying!\" replied Milly, getting louder.  \"I am\nengaged to be married to him, and haven't I a right to be here?  What\nright have you, I should like to know?  What has he been promising you?  A\npretty lot of nonsense, I expect!  But what Tony says to other women is\nall mere wind, and no concern to me!\"\n\n'\"Don't you be too sure!\" says Unity.  \"He's going to have Hannah, and\nnot you, nor me either; I could hear that.\"\n\n'Now at these strange voices sounding from under the cloth Hannah was\nthunderstruck a'most into a swound; and it was just at this time that the\nhorse moved on.  Hannah tugged away wildly, not knowing what she was\ndoing; and as the quarrel rose louder and louder Hannah got so horrified\nthat she let go the reins altogether.  The horse went on at his own pace,\nand coming to the corner where we turn round to drop down the hill to\nLower Longpuddle he turned too quick, the off wheels went up the bank,\nthe waggon rose sideways till it was quite on edge upon the near axles,\nand out rolled the three maidens into the road in a heap.\n\n'When Tony came up, frightened and breathless, he was relieved enough to\nsee that neither of his darlings was hurt, beyond a few scratches from\nthe brambles of the hedge.  But he was rather alarmed when he heard how\nthey were going on at one another.\n\n'\"Don't ye quarrel, my dears--don't ye!\" says he, taking off his hat out\nof respect to 'em.  And then he would have kissed them all round, as fair\nand square as a man could, but they were in too much of a taking to let\nhim, and screeched and sobbed till they was quite spent.\n\n'\"Now I'll speak out honest, because I ought to,\" says Tony, as soon as\nhe could get heard.  \"And this is the truth,\" says he.  \"I've asked\nHannah to be mine, and she is willing, and we are going to put up the\nbanns next--\"\n\n'Tony had not noticed that Hannah's father was coming up behind, nor had\nhe noticed that Hannah's face was beginning to bleed from the scratch of\na bramble.  Hannah had seen her father, and had run to him, crying worse\nthan ever.\n\n'\"My daughter is _not_ willing, sir!\" says Mr. Jolliver hot and strong.\n\"Be you willing, Hannah?  I ask ye to have spirit enough to refuse him,\nif yer virtue is left to 'ee and you run no risk?\"\n\n'\"She's as sound as a bell for me, that I'll swear!\" says Tony, flaring\nup.  \"And so's the others, come to that, though you may think it an\nonusual thing in me!\"\n\n'\"I have spirit, and I do refuse him!\" says Hannah, partly because her\nfather was there, and partly, too, in a tantrum because of the discovery,\nand the scratch on her face.  \"Little did I think when I was so soft with\nhim just now that I was talking to such a false deceiver!\"\n\n'\"What, you won't have me, Hannah?\" says Tony, his jaw hanging down like\na dead man's.\n\n'\"Never--I would sooner marry no--nobody at all!\" she gasped out, though\nwith her heart in her throat, for she would not have refused Tony if he\nhad asked her quietly, and her father had not been there, and her face\nhad not been scratched by the bramble.  And having said that, away she\nwalked upon her father's arm, thinking and hoping he would ask her again.\n\n'Tony didn't know what to say next.  Milly was sobbing her heart out; but\nas his father had strongly recommended her he couldn't feel inclined that\nway.  So he turned to Unity.\n\n'\"Well, will you, Unity dear, be mine?\" he says.\n\n'\"Take her leavings?  Not I!\" says Unity.  \"I'd scorn it!\"  And away\nwalks Unity Sallet likewise, though she looked back when she'd gone some\nway, to see if he was following her.\n\n'So there at last were left Milly and Tony by themselves, she crying in\nwatery streams, and Tony looking like a tree struck by lightning.\n\n'\"Well, Milly,\" he says at last, going up to her, \"it do seem as if fate\nhad ordained that it should be you and I, or nobody.  And what must be\nmust be, I suppose.  Hey, Milly?\"\n\n'\"If you like, Tony.  You didn't really mean what you said to them?\"\n\n'\"Not a word of it!\" declares Tony, bringing down his fist upon his palm.\n\n'And then he kissed her, and put the waggon to rights, and they mounted\ntogether; and their banns were put up the very next Sunday.  I was not\nable to go to their wedding, but it was a rare party they had, by all\naccount.  Everybody in Longpuddle was there almost; you among the rest, I\nthink, Mr. Flaxton?'  The speaker turned to the parish clerk.\n\n'I was,' said Mr. Flaxton.  'And that party was the cause of a very\ncurious change in some other people's affairs; I mean in Steve Hardcome's\nand his cousin James's.'\n\n'Ah! the Hardcomes,' said the stranger.  'How familiar that name is to\nme!  What of them?'\n\nThe clerk cleared his throat and began:--\n\n\nTHE HISTORY OF THE HARDCOMES\n\n\n'Yes, Tony's was the very best wedding-randy that ever I was at; and I've\nbeen at a good many, as you may suppose'--turning to the newly-arrived\none--'having as a church-officer, the privilege to attend all\nchristening, wedding, and funeral parties--such being our Wessex custom.\n\n''Twas on a frosty night in Christmas week, and among the folk invited\nwere the said Hardcomes o' Climmerston--Steve and James--first cousins,\nboth of them small farmers, just entering into business on their own\naccount.  With them came, as a matter of course, their intended wives,\ntwo young women of the neighbourhood, both very pretty and sprightly\nmaidens, and numbers of friends from Abbot's-Cernel, and Weatherbury, and\nMellstock, and I don't know where--a regular houseful.\n\n'The kitchen was cleared of furniture for dancing, and the old folk\nplayed at \"Put\" and \"All-fours\" in the parlour, though at last they gave\nthat up to join in the dance.  The top of the figure was by the large\nfront window of the room, and there were so many couples that the lower\npart of the figure reached through the door at the back, and into the\ndarkness of the out-house; in fact, you couldn't see the end of the row\nat all, and 'twas never known exactly how long that dance was, the lowest\ncouples being lost among the faggots and brushwood in the out-house.\n\n'When we had danced a few hours, and the crowns of we taller men were\nswelling into lumps with bumping the beams of the ceiling, the first\nfiddler laid down his fiddle-bow, and said he should play no more, for he\nwished to dance.  And in another hour the second fiddler laid down his,\nand said he wanted to dance too; so there was only the third fiddler\nleft, and he was a' old, veteran man, very weak in the wrist.  However,\nhe managed to keep up a faltering tweedle-dee; but there being no chair\nin the room, and his knees being as weak as his wrists, he was obliged to\nsit upon as much of the little corner-table as projected beyond the\ncorner-cupboard fixed over it, which was not a very wide seat for a man\nadvanced in years.\n\n'Among those who danced most continually were the two engaged couples, as\nwas natural to their situation.  Each pair was very well matched, and\nvery unlike the other.  James Hardcome's intended was called Emily Darth,\nand both she and James were gentle, nice-minded, in-door people, fond of\na quiet life.  Steve and his chosen, named Olive Pawle, were different;\nthey were of a more bustling nature, fond of racketing about and seeing\nwhat was going on in the world.  The two couples had arranged to get\nmarried on the same day, and that not long thence; Tony's wedding being a\nsort of stimulant, as is often the case; I've noticed it professionally\nmany times.\n\n'They danced with such a will as only young people in that stage of\ncourtship can dance; and it happened that as the evening wore on James\nhad for his partner Stephen's plighted one, Olive, at the same time that\nStephen was dancing with James's Emily.  It was noticed that in spite o'\nthe exchange the young men seemed to enjoy the dance no less than before.\nBy and by they were treading another tune in the same changed order as we\nhad noticed earlier, and though at first each one had held the other's\nmistress strictly at half-arm's length, lest there should be shown any\nobjection to too close quarters by the lady's proper man, as time passed\nthere was a little more closeness between 'em; and presently a little\nmore closeness still.\n\n'The later it got the more did each of the two cousins dance with the\nwrong young girl, and the tighter did he hold her to his side as he\nwhirled her round; and, what was very remarkable, neither seemed to mind\nwhat the other was doing.  The party began to draw towards its end, and I\nsaw no more that night, being one of the first to leave, on account of my\nmorning's business.  But I learnt the rest of it from those that knew.\n\n'After finishing a particularly warming dance with the changed partners,\nas I've mentioned, the two young men looked at one another, and in a\nmoment or two went out into the porch together.\n\n'\"James,\" says Steve, \"what were you thinking of when you were dancing\nwith my Olive?\"\n\n'\"Well,\" said James, \"perhaps what you were thinking of when you were\ndancing with my Emily.\"\n\n'\"I was thinking,\" said Steve, with some hesitation, \"that I wouldn't\nmind changing for good and all!\"\n\n'\"It was what I was feeling likewise,\" said James.\n\n'\"I willingly agree to it, if you think we could manage it.\"\n\n'\"So do I.  But what would the girls say?\"\n\n'\"'Tis my belief,\" said Steve, \"that they wouldn't particularly object.\nYour Emily clung as close to me as if she already belonged to me, dear\ngirl.\"\n\n'\"And your Olive to me,\" says James.  \"I could feel her heart beating\nlike a clock.\"\n\n'Well, they agreed to put it to the girls when they were all four walking\nhome together.  And they did so.  When they parted that night the\nexchange was decided on--all having been done under the hot excitement of\nthat evening's dancing.  Thus it happened that on the following Sunday\nmorning, when the people were sitting in church with mouths wide open to\nhear the names published as they had expected, there was no small\namazement to hear them coupled the wrong way, as it seemed.  The\ncongregation whispered, and thought the parson had made a mistake; till\nthey discovered that his reading of the names was verily the true way.  As\nthey had decided, so they were married, each one to the other's original\nproperty.\n\n'Well, the two couples lived on for a year or two ordinarily enough, till\nthe time came when these young people began to grow a little less warm to\ntheir respective spouses, as is the rule of married life; and the two\ncousins wondered more and more in their hearts what had made 'em so mad\nat the last moment to marry crosswise as they did, when they might have\nmarried straight, as was planned by nature, and as they had fallen in\nlove.  'Twas Tony's party that had done _it_, plain enough, and they half\nwished they had never gone there.  James, being a quiet, fireside,\nperusing man, felt at times a wide gap between himself and Olive, his\nwife, who loved riding and driving and out-door jaunts to a degree;\nwhile Steve, who was always knocking about hither and thither, had a very\ndomestic wife, who worked samplers, and made hearthrugs, scarcely ever\nwished to cross the threshold, and only drove out with him to please him.\n\n'However, they said very little about this mismating to any of their\nacquaintances, though sometimes Steve would look at James's wife and\nsigh, and James would look at Steve's wife and do the same.  Indeed, at\nlast the two men were frank enough towards each other not to mind\nmentioning it quietly to themselves, in a long-faced, sorry-smiling,\nwhimsical sort of way, and would shake their heads together over their\nfoolishness in upsetting a well-considered choice on the strength of an\nhour's fancy in the whirl and wildness of a dance.  Still, they were\nsensible and honest young fellows enough, and did their best to make\nshift with their lot as they had arranged it, and not to repine at what\ncould not now be altered or mended.\n\n'So things remained till one fine summer day they went for their yearly\nlittle outing together, as they had made it their custom to do for a long\nwhile past.  This year they chose Budmouth-Regis as the place to spend\ntheir holiday in; and off they went in their best clothes at nine o'clock\nin the morning.\n\n'When they had reached Budmouth-Regis they walked two and two along the\nshore--their new boots going squeakity-squash upon the clammy velvet\nsands.  I can seem to see 'em now!  Then they looked at the ships in the\nharbour; and then went up to the Look-out; and then had dinner at an inn;\nand then again walked two and two, squeakity-squash, upon the velvet\nsands.  As evening drew on they sat on one of the public seats upon the\nEsplanade, and listened to the band; and then they said \"What shall we do\nnext?\"\n\n'\"Of all things,\" said Olive (Mrs. James Hardcome, that is), \"I should\nlike to row in the bay!  We could listen to the music from the water as\nwell as from here, and have the fun of rowing besides.\"\n\n'\"The very thing; so should I,\" says Stephen, his tastes being always\nlike hers.\n\nHere the clerk turned to the curate.\n\n'But you, sir, know the rest of the strange particulars of that strange\nevening of their lives better than anybody else, having had much of it\nfrom their own lips, which I had not; and perhaps you'll oblige the\ngentleman?'\n\n'Certainly, if it is wished,' said the curate.  And he took up the\nclerk's tale:--\n\n* * * * *\n\n'Stephen's wife hated the sea, except from land, and couldn't bear the\nthought of going into a boat.  James, too, disliked the water, and said\nthat for his part he would much sooner stay on and listen to the band in\nthe seat they occupied, though he did not wish to stand in his wife's way\nif she desired a row.  The end of the discussion was that James and his\ncousin's wife Emily agreed to remain where they were sitting and enjoy\nthe music, while they watched the other two hire a boat just beneath, and\ntake their water-excursion of half an hour or so, till they should choose\nto come back and join the sitters on the Esplanade; when they would all\nstart homeward together.\n\n'Nothing could have pleased the other two restless ones better than this\narrangement; and Emily and James watched them go down to the boatman\nbelow and choose one of the little yellow skiffs, and walk carefully out\nupon the little plank that was laid on trestles to enable them to get\nalongside the craft.  They saw Stephen hand Olive in, and take his seat\nfacing her; when they were settled they waved their hands to the couple\nwatching them, and then Stephen took the pair of sculls and pulled off to\nthe tune beat by the band, she steering through the other boats skimming\nabout, for the sea was as smooth as glass that evening, and\npleasure-seekers were rowing everywhere.\n\n'\"How pretty they look moving on, don't they?\" said Emily to James (as\nI've been assured).  \"They both enjoy it equally.  In everything their\nlikings are the same.\"\n\n'\"That's true,\" said James.\n\n'\"They would have made a handsome pair if they had married,\" said she.\n\n'\"Yes,\" said he.  \"'Tis a pity we should have parted 'em\"\n\n'\"Don't talk of that, James,\" said she.  \"For better or for worse we\ndecided to do as we did, and there's an end of it.\"\n\n'They sat on after that without speaking, side by side, and the band\nplayed as before; the people strolled up and down; and Stephen and Olive\nshrank smaller and smaller as they shot straight out to sea.  The two on\nshore used to relate how they saw Stephen stop rowing a moment, and take\noff his coat to get at his work better; but James's wife sat quite still\nin the stern, holding the tiller-ropes by which she steered the boat.\nWhen they had got very small indeed she turned her head to shore.\n\n'\"She is waving her handkerchief to us,\" said Stephen's wife, who\nthereupon pulled out her own, and waved it as a return signal.\n\n'The boat's course had been a little awry while Mrs. James neglected her\nsteering to wave her handkerchief to her husband and Mrs. Stephen; but\nnow the light skiff went straight onward again, and they could soon see\nnothing more of the two figures it contained than Olive's light mantle\nand Stephen's white shirt sleeves behind.\n\n'The two on the shore talked on.  \"'Twas very curious--our changing\npartners at Tony Kytes's wedding,\" Emily declared.  \"Tony was of a fickle\nnature by all account, and it really seemed as if his character had\ninfected us that night.  Which of you two was it that first proposed not\nto marry as we were engaged?\"\n\n'\"H'm--I can't remember at this moment,\" says James.  \"We talked it over,\nyou know; and no sooner said than done.\"\n\n'\"'Twas the dancing,\" said she.  \"People get quite crazy sometimes in a\ndance.\"\n\n'\"They do,\" he owned.\n\n'\"James--do you think they care for one another still?\" asks Mrs.\nStephen.\n\n'James Hardcome mused and admitted that perhaps a little tender feeling\nmight flicker up in their hearts for a moment now and then.  \"Still,\nnothing of any account,\" he said.\n\n'\"I sometimes think that Olive is in Steve's mind a good deal,\" murmurs\nMrs. Stephen; \"particularly when she pleases his fancy by riding past our\nwindow at a gallop on one of the draught-horses . . . I never could do\nanything of that sort; I could never get over my fear of a horse.\"\n\n'\"And I am no horseman, though I pretend to be on her account,\" murmured\nJames Hardcome.  \"But isn't it almost time for them to turn and sweep\nround to the shore, as the other boating folk have done?  I wonder what\nOlive means by steering away straight to the horizon like that?  She has\nhardly swerved from a direct line seaward since they started.\"\n\n'\"No doubt they are talking, and don't think of where they are going,\"\nsuggests Stephen's wife.\n\n'\"Perhaps so,\" said James.  \"I didn't know Steve could row like that.\"\n\n'\"O yes,\" says she.  \"He often comes here on business, and generally has\na pull round the bay.\"\n\n'\"I can hardly see the boat or them,\" says James again; \"and it is\ngetting dark.\"\n\n'The heedless pair afloat now formed a mere speck in the films of the\ncoming night, which thickened apace, till it completely swallowed up\ntheir distant shapes.  They had disappeared while still following the\nsame straight course away from the world of land-livers, as if they were\nintending to drop over the sea-edge into space, and never return to earth\nagain.\n\n'The two on the shore continued to sit on, punctually abiding by their\nagreement to remain on the same spot till the others returned.  The\nEsplanade lamps were lit one by one, the bandsmen folded up their stands\nand departed, the yachts in the bay hung out their riding lights, and the\nlittle boats came back to shore one after another, their hirers walking\non to the sands by the plank they had climbed to go afloat; but among\nthese Stephen and Olive did not appear.\n\n'\"What a time they are!\" said Emily.  \"I am getting quite chilly.  I did\nnot expect to have to sit so long in the evening air.\"\n\n'Thereupon James Hardcome said that he did not require his overcoat, and\ninsisted on lending it to her.\n\n'He wrapped it round Emily's shoulders.\n\n'\"Thank you, James,\" she said.  \"How cold Olive must be in that thin\njacket!\"\n\n'He said he was thinking so too.  \"Well, they are sure to be quite close\nat hand by this time, though we can't see 'em.  The boats are not all in\nyet.  Some of the rowers are fond of paddling along the shore to finish\nout their hour of hiring.\"\n\n'\"Shall we walk by the edge of the water,\" said she, \"to see if we can\ndiscover them?\"\n\n'He assented, reminding her that they must not lose sight of the seat,\nlest the belated pair should return and miss them, and be vexed that they\nhad not kept the appointment.\n\n'They walked a sentry beat up and down the sands immediately opposite the\nseat; and still the others did not come.  James Hardcome at last went to\nthe boatman, thinking that after all his wife and cousin might have come\nin under shadow of the dusk without being perceived, and might have\nforgotten the appointment at the bench.\n\n'\"All in?\" asked James.\n\n'\"All but one boat,\" said the lessor.  \"I can't think where that couple\nis keeping to.  They might run foul of something or other in the dark.\"\n\n'Again Stephen's wife and Olive's husband waited, with more and more\nanxiety.  But no little yellow boat returned.  Was it possible they could\nhave landed further down the Esplanade?\n\n'\"It may have been done to escape paying,\" said the boat-owner.  \"But\nthey didn't look like people who would do that.\"\n\n'James Hardcome knew that he could found no hope on such a reason as\nthat.  But now, remembering what had been casually discussed between\nSteve and himself about their wives from time to time, he admitted for\nthe first time the possibility that their old tenderness had been revived\nby their face-to-face position more strongly than either had anticipated\nat starting--the excursion having been so obviously undertaken for the\npleasure of the performance only,--and that they had landed at some steps\nhe knew of further down toward the pier, to be longer alone together.\n\n'Still he disliked to harbour the thought, and would not mention its\nexistence to his companion.  He merely said to her, \"Let us walk further\non.\"\n\n'They did so, and lingered between the boat-stage and the pier till\nStephen Hardcome's wife was uneasy, and was obliged to accept James's\noffered arm.  Thus the night advanced.  Emily was presently so worn out\nby fatigue that James felt it necessary to conduct her home; there was,\ntoo, a remote chance that the truants had landed in the harbour on the\nother side of the town, or elsewhere, and hastened home in some\nunexpected way, in the belief that their consorts would not have waited\nso long.\n\n'However, he left a direction in the town that a lookout should be kept,\nthough this was arranged privately, the bare possibility of an elopement\nbeing enough to make him reticent; and, full of misgivings, the two\nremaining ones hastened to catch the last train out of Budmouth-Regis;\nand when they got to Casterbridge drove back to Upper Longpuddle.'\n\n'Along this very road as we do now,' remarked the parish clerk.\n\n'To be sure--along this very road,' said the curate.  'However, Stephen\nand Olive were not at their homes; neither had entered the village since\nleaving it in the morning.  Emily and James Hardcome went to their\nrespective dwellings to snatch a hasty night's rest, and at daylight the\nnext morning they drove again to Casterbridge and entered the Budmouth\ntrain, the line being just opened.\n\n'Nothing had been heard of the couple there during this brief absence.  In\nthe course of a few hours some young men testified to having seen such a\nman and woman rowing in a frail hired craft, the head of the boat kept\nstraight to sea; they had sat looking in each other's faces as if they\nwere in a dream, with no consciousness of what they were doing, or\nwhither they were steering.  It was not till late that day that more\ntidings reached James's ears.  The boat had been found drifting bottom\nupward a long way from land.  In the evening the sea rose somewhat, and a\ncry spread through the town that two bodies were cast ashore in Lullstead\nBay, several miles to the eastward.  They were brought to Budmouth, and\ninspection revealed them to be the missing pair.  It was said that they\nhad been found tightly locked in each other's arms, his lips upon hers,\ntheir features still wrapt in the same calm and dream-like repose which\nhad been observed in their demeanour as they had glided along.\n\n'Neither James nor Emily questioned the original motives of the\nunfortunate man and woman in putting to sea.  They were both above\nsuspicion as to intention.  Whatever their mutual feelings might have led\nthem on to, underhand behaviour was foreign to the nature of either.\nConjecture pictured that they might have fallen into tender reverie while\ngazing each into a pair of eyes that had formerly flashed for him and her\nalone, and, unwilling to avow what their mutual sentiments were, they had\ncontinued thus, oblivious of time and space, till darkness suddenly\novertook them far from land.  But nothing was truly known.  It had been\ntheir destiny to die thus.  The two halves, intended by Nature to make\nthe perfect whole, had failed in that result during their lives, though\n\"in their death they were not divided.\"  Their bodies were brought home,\nand buried on one day.  I remember that, on looking round the churchyard\nwhile reading the service, I observed nearly all the parish at their\nfuneral.'\n\n'It was so, sir,' said the clerk.\n\n'The remaining two,' continued the curate (whose voice had grown husky\nwhile relating the lovers' sad fate), 'were a more thoughtful and far-\nseeing, though less romantic, couple than the first.  They were now\nmutually bereft of a companion, and found themselves by this accident in\na position to fulfil their destiny according to Nature's plan and their\nown original and calmly-formed intention.  James Hardcome took Emily to\nwife in the course of a year and a half; and the marriage proved in every\nrespect a happy one.  I solemnized the service, Hardcome having told me,\nwhen he came to give notice of the proposed wedding, the story of his\nfirst wife's loss almost word for word as I have told it to you.'\n\n'And are they living in Longpuddle still?' asked the new-comer.\n\n'O no, sir,' interposed the clerk.  'James has been dead these dozen\nyears, and his mis'ess about six or seven.  They had no children.  William\nPrivett used to be their odd man till he died.'\n\n'Ah--William Privett!  He dead too?--dear me!' said the other.  'All\npassed away!'\n\n'Yes, sir.  William was much older than I.  He'd ha' been over eighty if\nhe had lived till now.'\n\n'There was something very strange about William's death--very strange\nindeed!' sighed a melancholy man in the back of the van.  It was the\nseedsman's father, who had hitherto kept silence.\n\n'And what might that have been?' asked Mr. Lackland.\n\n","My friend and I's first experience with acid happened May 12 of 2006. We had just gotten out of school so we figured hey, lets get some acid. We'd both done shrooms a couple of times before but that was it for hallucinogens.\n\n7:30AM - we had only gotten a couple of hours of sleep the night before (anticipation) and decided we'd go to the local waffle house for a nice breakfast of Acid and water :) We put the fat blue-stained tabs on our tongues on the way and got our semi-retarded but sober friend to drive us there. Our first indications of anything different were probably about an hour after the drop at the waffle house. With the tabs still on our tongues, we decided to swallow them with water at our table. My friend looked down at a spoon that was next to me and said 'Oh fuck' because my face was starting to 'transform'. I didn't notice any change until we got up to leave, when suddenly I felt really unnaturally tall. The ground was kind of slanted and colors took on a brighter, more vivid effect.\n\nThen it happened. As we got into the car, we went into neverland. All of a sudden it had the effect of a mild mushroom trip and we decided to head for my friend's house because his parents were out. By the time we arrived, it was really starting to hit. Nothing freaked us out at this point even though neither of us had experienced as intense a thing as this before. Once inside, the hallucinations started happening. My first one I'll never forget was lookin at a statue on the mantle and watching it transform into a serpant and slither around. My friend started talkin to the horse head picture on the wall - he said it was pokin out and talking to him. Every aspect of the room seemed to be alive and in its own universe.\n\nOur other friend/sitter decided to go out on the porch and smoke a joint while we continued trippin our balls off. Next stage of the trip, the bathroom. I walked in to take a piss and before I was able to turn on the lights, I had the most intense, realistic hallucinations of people and character's faces coming at me through the darkness. I yelled at my friend to get in there and he saw igniting sparks flying around his head. While our friend was blazing outside we went into the basement to attempt to play pool. HAHAHA. Right. We ended up hunting giraffes on a safari thinkin the pool cue's were spears. Our other sober friend came downstairs and I tried talking to him but I kept seeing things manifest from his face, mainly banana-stalks and images of fruit.\n\nMy trippin friend had left the room to go watch his countertop 'breathe' so I took the opportunity to stick my head into the freezer. Man the images I saw, I can't even describe it. Eventually all 4 of us wound up upstairs and then all hell broke loose. Our beautiful experience was about to turn into a hellish nightmare by the call of one person, my friend's dad. Apparently his dad chose this day of all days to hound his ass on the phone about him not coming home the night before and fully expecting him to be home in a couple of hours. Now we were in trouble - we had planned to stay the entire trip at his house and we had to leave. As if it weren't enough, our friends both bailed on us and so there we were, 2 acid heads outside watching our friends drive away and trying to figure out what to do with poolsticks in our hands.\n\nAfter an eternity of panic (2 real minutes) I called my other friend and told him our situation. We convinced him to drive down and babysit us, so again we were good for about another hour until my friend's dad started calling again. No way could he have talked to him on the phone, we were so far gone from reality at this point that nothing, not even 4 word text messages made sense to us. So began our grand journey. We got our friend to drive us to the local park so we could walk around. We were so fucked up that our only goal was to kill time until we could come down to reality and face society again.\n\nAs soon as we were on the walking/bike path, we noticed our first heavy tracers when bikers would go by and their doubles would keep passing us for another 2 minutes. The jungle had never looked so alive. Everything was moving and breathing, and I think this is where sounds started to mesh with sight and taste. I remember 'tasting' the green of the leaves and hearing the trails of the bikers. Well that lasted about 5 minutes real time (3 hours ours) so we told our friend to drive us anywhere else, which ended up being another park. When we stopped in the parking lot we met another friend who freaked us the fuck out. He kept saying he had a friend who was a sheriff and he was gonna get us arrested and into a drug program.\n\nSo then all of us went to this pizza joint and ordered a large pepperoni. My friend's distorted image of the waitress was beyond ridiculous, he said 'When she put the pizza on the table her face went with it and landed in the middle of the cheese.' By now people's faces were melting and shape-shifting, it was nearly impossible to talk to people, or so we thought, apparently we sounded fine the whole time but we sure as hell didn't feel like we did. There was pizza in front of us and we just couldn't eat - just too fucked up, so its about hour 5 or 6 with no food. Next we, in our brilliancy, decided it would be smart to try to go to a movie just to pass the time. This was the dumbest thing we've ever done. On the way to the theater we happened to see a live car accident as it happened (confirmed by our sober friends), and as if that weren't enough all the times and titles on the theater listings were backwards in real life, which just made us feel more crazier.\n\nBy now we started to get worried that the trip wouldn't end - that's where the panic started. When we walked into the theater, we thought we saw a crowded room with people in every seat, then our friend told us there was only one lady in the very back and suddenly we saw how empty it was. This made us just lose it. The sound meshing of the theater's bass mixed with our howling screams (at the previews) was too much to take. As my friend was busy watching the spindles of light manifest and rotate about the movie screen, I went into the deepest meditative state I've ever been in my life. My eyes were crosseyed and I literally saw what I'd call the spindles of consciousness. Two spinning fibrous greenish tornado beings is the best I can do to describe it. All the while my friend was too freaked out to sit still and started yelling at me in my ear. It sounded like he was a hundred miles away, I could barely hear him I was so far in my own mind. So our sober friend quickly ushered us out and back in the car, 20 dollars wasted on a movie where we didn't even make it past the 3rd preview.\n\nWe went to another friend's house who had just gotten home from school and her parents were gone. We tried hookin up the xbox and playin some halo2, I think I got 26 suicides while seriously trying to play and my friend kept dropping the controller and staring at the ceiling. And then outa nowhere her mom walked in. I can't even tell you the panic. Somehow we talked to her for a few minutes and she left, and then we went outside to the tire swing. This was def. one of the best and scariest parts of the trip. We had our friends wind us up and spin us on the swing, and when we opened our eyes it was like total mind-meltdown, I couldn't even tell you what planet I was on.\n\nSo even longer story short, night came and we were about 14 hours into the trip and still hardcore tripping, I mean tracers and hallucinations, no sign of a comedown. This is what freaked us out the most, everywhere we read had said 12 hours max and we were fucked beyond yesterday. We panicked cause we both were supposed to be home at certain times and we had to get our sober friends to write text messages to our parents telling them we were out for the night. Our best idea at the time was to tell our parents the next day we had been wasted cause anything would be better than them finding out we did acid.\n\n9:45pm and only a small hint of a comedown. our friend said she'd drive us to a local pharmacy and get us some herbal shit. It was supposed to 'detox' us or somethin but we both knew it was bullshit and we couldn't remember how to swallow pills anyway so we stuffed em in our pockets and pretended to take them. When we got back to her house we were way freaking out and decided it was up to us to learn how to 'reintegrate into society'. We tried immitating the other 'humans' aka non-acid-takers we saw in her house by eating muffins and playing cards. That lasted 20 seconds, we were too fucked to tell what our cards were or understand any purpose of the game.\n\n11pm still trippin and we have our original friend from the morning pick us up and take us to his house to crash for the night. In the meantime we had talked to dogs, plotted a genius escape by making our caretakers think we had disappeared and killed each other, and watched the most beautiful sunset you could possibly imagine.\n\nSo back at the house we attempted to go to sleep. 2 in the morning and we knew we were coming down but we still weren't sure when the hell it was all gonna be over. We had told our friend to sleep in the room with us in case his mom would have come down or something but that lazy mullet-haired water-head down syndrom son of a bitch said he wanted to sleep upstairs and that he'd be back in the morning. So after he leaves, we freak out for the last time of the trip and take it upon ourselves to create a 'fake friend' for our comfort lol. We put covers over a bunch of pillows to make it look like someone was asleep on the sofa and for whatever reason it just worked, totally reassured us for the rest of the night.\n\nAbout 4am and we were in and out of sleep, still really restless from almost 20 hours of non-stop tripping and NOTHING to eat all day. The tv was on but anytime we'd see human faces it would just freak us out and remind us how not normal we were, so we put it on the golf channel (and we HATE golf) all night just because there wasn't anything to horrific about watching a ball cross a green. After what seemed to be nine eternities (literally watching the seconds of the clock for hours) we somehow slept for a couple hours and awoke in the morning.\n\nVisuals had returned to normal but the lingering psychosis was still there, we just didn't feel like ourselves. We felt in some way detatched and we didn't think we were ready to go back into society. But we went our separate ways and that was that, followed by the next two days of reintegration. Things and thoughts became normal but it was an agonizingly slow process. The first time I talked to my mom the day after the trip I almost puked I was so nervous, but I sounded fine on the outside.\n\n","\nOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“‘Tis some visiter,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door--\nOnly this, and nothing more.”\n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\nNameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“‘Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door--\nSome late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;--\nThis it is, and nothing more.”\n\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you “--here I opened wide the door;----\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”--\nMerely this, and nothing more.\n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--\n‘Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore--\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the raven “Nevermore.”\n\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n\nBut the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before--\nOn the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf “Never--nevermore.”\n\nBut the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplght gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o’er,\n_She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent\nthee\nRespite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n\n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--\nOn this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--\nIs there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n\n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n\n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting--\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n\nAnd the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted--nevermore!\n\n","Article 901: Scope and Coverage\n1. This Chapter applies to standards-related measures of a Party, other than those covered by Section B of Chapter Seven (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade in goods or services between the Parties, and to measures of the Parties relating to such measures.\n2. Technical specifications prepared by governmental bodies for production or consumption requirements of such bodies shall be governed exclusively by Chapter Ten (Government Procurement).\nArticle 902: Extent of Obligations\n1. Article 105 (Extent of Obligations) does not apply to this Chapter.\n2. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure observance of Articles 904 through 908 by state or provincial governments and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory.\nArticle 903: Affirmation of Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and Other Agreements\nFurther to Article 103 (Relation to Other Agreements), the Parties affirm with respect to each other their existing rights and obligations relating to standards-related measures under the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and all other international agreements, including environmental and conservation agreements, to which those Parties are party.\nArticle 904: Basic Rights and Obligations\nRight to Take Standards-Related Measures\n1. Each Party may, in accordance with this Agreement, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure, including any such measure relating to safety, the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, and any measure to ensure its enforcement or implementation. Such measures include those to prohibit the importation of a good of another Party or the provision of a service by a service provider of another Party that fails to comply with the applicable requirements of those measures or to complete the Party's approval procedures.\nRight to Establish Level of Protection\n2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, each Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives of safety or the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, establish the levels of protection that it considers appropriate in accordance with Article 907(2).\nNon-Discriminatory Treatment\n3. Each Party shall, in respect of its standards-related measures, accord to goods and service providers of another Party:\n\n(a) national treatment in accordance with Article 301 (Market Access) or Article 1202 (Cross-Border Trade in Services); and\n(b) treatment no less favorable than that it accords to like goods, or in like circumstances to service providers, of any other country.\nUnnecessary Obstacles\n4. No Party may prepare, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure with a view to or with the effect of creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties. An unnecessary obstacle to trade shall not be deemed to be created where:\n\n(a) the demonstrable purpose of the measure is to achieve a legitimate objective; and\n(b) the measure does not operate to exclude goods of another Party that meet that legitimate objective.\nArticle 905: Use of International Standards\n1. Each Party shall use, as a basis for its standards-related measures, relevant international standards or international standards whose completion is imminent, except where such standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means to fulfill its legitimate objectives, for example because of fundamental climatic, geographical, technological or infrastructural factors, scientific justification or the level of protection that the Party considers appropriate.\n2. A Party's standards-related measure that conforms to an international standard shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 904(3) and (4).\n3. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, from adopting, maintaining or applying any standards-related measure that results in a higher level of protection than would be achieved if the measure were based on the relevant international standard.\nArticle 906: Compatibility and Equivalence\n1. Recognizing the crucial role of standards-related measures in achieving legitimate objectives, the Parties shall, in accordance with this Chapter, work jointly to enhance the level of safety and of protection of human, animal and plant life and health, the environment and consumers.\n2. Without reducing the level of safety or of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, without prejudice to the rights of any Party under this Chapter, and taking into account international standardization activities, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable, make compatible their respective standards-related measures, so as to facilitate trade in a good or service between the Parties.\n3. Further to Articles 902 and 905, a Party shall, on request of another Party, seek, through appropriate measures, to promote the compatibility of a specific standard or conformity assessment procedure that is maintained in its territory with the standards or conformity assessment procedures maintained in the territory of the other Party.\n4. Each importing Party shall treat a technical regulation adopted or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with the importing Party, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the importing Party that its technical regulation adequately fulfills the importing Party's legitimate objectives.\n5. The importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party, on request, its reasons in writing for not treating a technical regulation as equivalent under paragraph 4.\n6. Each Party shall, wherever possible, accept the results of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of another Party, provided that it is satisfied that the procedure offers an assurance, equivalent to that provided by a procedure it conducts or a procedure conducted in its territory the results of which it accepts, that the relevant good or service complies with the applicable technical regulation or standard adopted or maintained in the Party's territory.\n7. Prior to accepting the results of a conformity assessment procedure pursuant to paragraph 6, and to enhance confidence in the continued reliability of each other's conformity assessment results, the Parties may consult on such matters as the technical competence of the conformity assessment bodies involved, including verified compliance with relevant international standards through such means as accreditation.\nArticle 907: Assessment of Risk\n1. A Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, conduct an assessment of risk. In conducting an assessment, a Party may take into account, among other factors relating to a good or service:\n\n(a) available scientific evidence or technical information;\n(b) intended end uses;\n(c) processes or production, operating, inspection, sampling or testing methods; or\n(d) environmental conditions.\n2. Where pursuant to Article 904(2) a Party establishes a level of protection that it considers appropriate and conducts an assessment of risk, it should avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions between similar goods or services in the level of protection it considers appropriate, where the distinctions:\n\n(a) result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against goods or service providers of another Party;\n(b) constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties; or\n(c) discriminate between similar goods or services for the same use under the same conditions that pose the same level of risk and provide similar benefits.\n3. Where a Party conducting an assessment of risk determines that available scientific evidence or other information is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a provisional technical regulation on the basis of available relevant information. The Party shall, within a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the assessment of risk is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and, where appropriate, revise the provisional technical regulation in the light of that assessment.\nArticle 908: Conformity Assessment\n1. The Parties shall, further to Article 906 and recognizing the existence of substantial differences in the structure, organization and operation of conformity assessment procedures in their respective territories, make compatible those procedures to the greatest extent practicable.\n2. Recognizing that it should be to the mutual advantage of the Parties concerned and except as set out in Annex 908.2, each Party shall accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies in the territory of another Party on terms no less favorable than those accorded to conformity assessment bodies in its territory.\n3. Each Party shall, with respect to its conformity assessment procedures:\n\n(a) not adopt or maintain any such procedure that is stricter, nor apply the procedure more strictly, than necessary to give it confidence that a good or a service conforms with an applicable technical regulation or standard, taking into account the risks that non-conformity would create;\n(b) initiate and complete the procedure as expeditiously as possible;\n(c) in accordance with Article 904(3), undertake processing of applications in non-discriminatory order;\n(d) publish the normal processing period for each such procedure or communicate the anticipated processing period to an applicant on request;\n(e) ensure that the competent body\n\n(i) on receipt of an application, promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of any deficiency,\n(ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible the results of the conformity assessment procedure in a form that is precise and complete so that the applicant may take any necessary corrective action,\n(iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds as far as practicable with the procedure where the applicant so requests, and\n(iv) informs the applicant, on request, of the status of the application and the reasons for any delay;\n(f) limit the information the applicant is required to supply to that necessary to conduct the procedure and to determine appropriate fees;\n(g) accord confidential or proprietary information arising from, or supplied in connection with, the conduct of the procedure for a good of another Party or for a service provided by a person of another Party\n\n(i) the same treatment as that for a good of the Party or a service provided by a person of the Party, and\n(ii) in any event, treatment that protects an applicant's legitimate commercial interests to the extent provided under the Party's law;\n(h) ensure that any fee it imposes for conducting the procedure is no higher for a good of another Party or a service provider of another Party than is equitable in relation to any such fee imposed for its like goods or service providers or for like goods or service providers of any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and other related costs;\n(i) ensure that the location of facilities at which a conformity assessment procedure is conducted does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent;\n(j) limit the procedure, for a good or service modified subsequent to a determination that the good or service conforms to the applicable technical regulation or standard, to that necessary to determine that the good or service continues to conform to the technical regulation or standard; and\n(k) limit any requirement regarding samples of a good to that which is reasonable, and ensure that the selection of samples does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent.\n4. Each Party shall apply, with such modifications as may be necessary, the relevant provisions of paragraph 3 to its approval procedures.\n5. Each Party shall, on request of another Party, take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate access in its territory for conformity assessment activities.\n6. Each Party shall give sympathetic consideration to a request by another Party to negotiate agreements for the mutual recognition of the results of that other Party's conformity assessment procedures.\nArticle 909: Notification, Publication, and Provision of Information\n1.

Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure, with respect to a technical regulation of a state or provincial government other than a local government:\n\n(a) that, at an early appropriate stage, a notice and notification of the type required under paragraph 1(a) and (b) are made prior to their adoption; and\n(b) observance of paragraph (c) and (d).\n4. Where a Party considers it necessary to address an urgent problem relating to safety or to protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, it may omit any step set out in paragraph 1 or 3, provided that on adoption of a standards-related measure it shall:\n\n(a) immediately provide to the other Parties a notification of the type required under paragraph 1(b), including a brief description of the urgent problem;\n(b) provide a copy of the measure to any Party or interested person that so requests; and\n(c) without discrimination, allow other Parties and interested persons to make comments in writing, and shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account.\n5. Each Party shall, except where necessary to address an urgent problem referred to in paragraph 4, allow a reasonable period between the publication of a standards-related measure and the date that it becomes effective to allow time for interested persons to adapt to the measure.\n6. Where a Party allows non-governmental persons in its territory to be present during the process of development of standards-related measures, it shall also allow non-governmental persons from the territories of the other Parties to be present.\n7.

Where a Party designates more than one inquiry point, it shall:\n\n(a) provide to the other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope of responsibility of each inquiry point; and\n(b) ensure that any inquiry addressed to an incorrect inquiry point is promptly conveyed to the correct inquiry point.\n3. Each Party shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure that there is at least one inquiry point that is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from other Parties and interested persons and to provide relevant documents or information as to where they can be obtained regarding:\n\n(a) any standard or conformity assessment procedure proposed, adopted or maintained by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory; and\n(b) the membership and participation of relevant non-governmental bodies in its territory in international and regional standardizing bodies and conformity assessment systems.\n4.

I've also done salvia 3 times, with very positive results, and mushrooms twice, also with very positive results, which made me get more interested in trying more drugs, such as acid and MDMA.\n\nMy roommate had mentioned earlier in the week that he was going to a rave this weekend, so I asked if he was rolling. When he said that he was, I asked if I could get in on that and he was very excited to include me in his rave group, which would now be 7 people, including both of us, with only one other person I knew. I had never been to a rave before and had never done ecstasy before, so I was both excited and nervous about the experience.\n\nI smoked almost two hours before we left, so I was still a little high when we piled into the car to drive to the rave. I was sitting in the trunk of an SUV with my roommate and the driver was driving (I thought) really fast and recklessly. This was starting to scare me, as I thought about how I wasn't wearing a seat belt because I was in the very back of the suv, about how we had drugs on us if we were pulled over for speeding (which he was) and about the fact that I was going to do a drug that I had never tried before and that could potentially have some negative effects.\n\nWe got to the warehouse that was hosting the rave and parked and all 7 of us took our first pill. This was at approximately 8:45 pm. My roommate and his friends already had their tickets to the rave so they found the presale line and entered, with my roommate telling me to call him once I got in. I found the line I needed, for people without tickets, which was extremely long and settled in to wait.\n\nAs the line moved slowly and I got closer to the entrance, (T + 0:30), I started getting more and more anxiety. There were cops driving by and occasionally shining lights in our direction, lots of noise and people running around, and it was a pretty sketchy looking area. They say setting is everything with drugs and at this moment, I wasn't comfortable alone where I was, I was worried about the effects of the drug and was pretty much convinced I would have a bad experience. I remember specifically thinking that I was stupid for doing this at night in a setting I didn't know, and regretting not doing this during the day, in my room where I would feel comfortable. I also noticed that I was swaying back and forth in line pretty consistently, and I started wondering if this was the ex setting in or if it was normal for me to sway back and forth while standing in one place for a long time.\n\nI finally got into the rave's outside area (there were 3 stages, one outside, a larger one inside, and another one on the other side of the inside stage) at T: + 0:45 and started to walk towards where my roommate told me to meet him. At this point, I noticed the first concrete effects of the dose starting to kick in: walking felt very weird, as though I could feel the air that I was moving through. There was almost a slight resistance to the air around me, like being underwater but subtler. It was not dissimilar to being high. I filed this away for later and met up with my roommate and his friends. We were sitting on the ground near the front outside stage, close enough to feel some vibrations from the subwoofers. I could not honestly tell you what kind of music was playing, but I think it's safe to say it was electronic or dance of some kind. It was danceable, that's all that's important.\n\nWe sat there for about 20 minutes relatively quietly as we slowly started to feel the effects of the initial dose (T+1:00). Someone, maybe me, maybe someone else, said something along the lines of 'I feel really good,' to which the rest of us all said, in unison 'Yeahhhhhh'. This continued for about 5 minutes, as each of us realized how GOOD we were all feeling. It was an incredible body high, the initial onset of the 'Ecstasy' that gives the drug its name: we just all felt so GOOD! Someone eventually had the bright idea to go dance to the music, which sounded like a really great idea at the time, and we moved to the dance floor.\n\nI'm not much of a dancer; I'm really too tall and awkward and uncoordinated to be a good dancer under normal or even alcohol-related conditions. But as we joined the growing number of people dancing in front of the outside stage, I didn't feel awkward or uncoordinated. All I felt was that growing body high and growing feeling of GOOD that was being fed and amplified by the music. And the MUSIC! Good god, this was IT! This was EXACTLY what I wanted to listen to right now! And the BASS! Wow!\n\nI probably said a lot of this out loud to my friends, who nodded and smiled and agreed with me. I was doing my usual nodding and swaying, which is typically as much dancing as I feel comfortable doing in public, and quickly progressing past it. I was really getting into this music and this dancing, and a quick look around assured me that everyone else was too and no one was even thinking about mocking my 'poor' dancing. I abandoned all self-consciousness about dancing from this point forward.\n\nAfter what seemed like a couple minutes, someone tapped me on the shoulder. It was Ashley, one of the girls in our group, the one besides my roommate that I knew before tonight. She motioned me to follow her out of the dance-area. Apparently, our group was taking a break. I was incredulous. We had just started dancing! And I was feeling so GOOD about dancing! Why would anyone want to stop dancing, even for a minute? And only minutes after we had started? Someone told me that it had been like 45 minutes. Oh. (T+1:45).\n\nI sat for maybe 5 minutes, bobbing my head and swaying to the music, which was getting pretty unfreakingbelievable, and then I heard a familiar noise. It was the opening sounds to 'Warp 1.9' by the Bloody Beetroots (the song that goes 'One! Two! Woop! Woop!' and then gets really heavy), which I absolutely love, especially when high. I immediately knew that this song would wreck me in my current state, and I HAD to dance to it. I informed the group that I was going to go dance some more and Ashley immediately grinned and stood up to follow me. She was right on my level (I got the sense that maybe a couple of the others were having some issues adjusting to the come-up process and the rolling itself, but I wasn't and I wanted to dance).\n\nThe song wrecked me. I lost my shit. I danced like I had never danced before. I texted my two closest friends that had rolled before (V and C), and told them what was up (the song and that I was rolling in general; V in particular had pushed me to try E and loved this song). I felt a sudden connection to them, because they had been exactly where I was now before and I understood where they were when they rolled. It's hard to put into words, but anyone who has rolled before will understand what I mean: when you're rolling, you want to ask people if they're rolling so that you can smile at them and they can smile back, because you are both in the same place and you both completely understand how the other feels at this moment. It's incredible.\n\nAt this point, I lose track of chronological order of things. I remember bits and pieces, but mostly I remember dancing. According to a text I sent to C, I took my second dose at around 10:45, which would be T+2:00, but time was a pretty fickle thing that night. I was still not at the peak of the first dose when I took the second (which I think is a good point to take another if you plan to, because then the peak of the first masks and hastens the come-up of the second) and I was feeling amazing at that point. I could have done anything. I loved everyone there. I could have hugged the world. It wasn't a sense of 'ecstasy' or straight up happiness like the name might imply; I wasn't quite euphoric or giddy with happiness (although that was a part of it and I was pretty happy). I just felt as good as I've ever felt in my life, physically, mentally and everything else. And I wanted to dance.\n\nI remember someone twirling glow sticks in someone's face, as the glow stick-ee watched in amazement. I stood next to them, watching the colors spiral and jump around and run in and out of one another. It was mind-blowing. He finished with them and started spinning in my face. I could have watched the light show for hours. He eventually moved on to someone else and I thanked him profusely.\n\nI remember moving inside to the big stage, which was crowded with people, all rolling, all dancing, all my new best friends. I instantly loved everyone there. I met a guy named 'Hoopy' and we instantly bonded over our shared rolling. We were exactly on each other's level. We exchanged names and phone numbers, because we already knew that we were friends.\n\nI went back and forth between the front outside stage and the main stage inside for a while, texting people while I walked. I told people that I loved them. I saw people wearing soft, fuzzy hats and I walked up to them and rubbed their hats. They smiled and stopped moving so that I could rub their hat for a few seconds until I smiled, hugged them, thanked them and moved on. One person's hat had fuzzy strings with a fuzzy poofball attached at the end hanging from the hat. I started to rub his hat and he took the fuzzy poofballs and rubbed my face and closed eyelids with them. It was mindblowing, the softest things I had ever felt.\n\nThere was some intensely dirty dubstep playing outside. I joined a circle of people going crazy near the stage. Every time a beat dropped, the circle would drop in unison, moving up and down to the slow, thunderous beat.\n\nI remember moving back inside for what I think was a large portion of the night. I took my shirt off and tucked it into my shorts at some point, because it was getting sweaty and the fans that were blowing felt amazing on my bare skin. I'm not a shirtless kind of guy in public, I normally think that guys who walk around shirtless in public look like douches, but that night, I knew that no one would judge me and that I wouldn't judge myself. This was a night for being free and abandoning everything to dance. Why wouldn't I be shirtless?\n\nI remember someone giving me a backrub. It was amazing enough for me to stop dancing for several minutes. I remember more glowsticks being twirled in my face. Someone had thrown really big balloon-like things into the crowd that would vibrate intensely with the beat. I pressed one against my face and felt the vibrations and it was unreal. Someone pressed one against my other check, so that my face was sandwiched between these two vibrating balloons. I could barely function. It was that intense and amazing.\n\nI remember having to swallow my gum while dancing because I had literally chewed it apart. Not 10 seconds later, someone tapped me on the shoulder and handed me a piece of gum. I turned and thanked them and asked how they knew, because gum was exactly what I needed right then. He just smiled at me.\n\nI remember eventually taking a piss break. I peed for like 40 seconds. I know this sounds weird, but it was literally the best piss I've ever taken. I remember telling my group this fact and they all agreed with me that peeing felt awesome.\n\nI remember not having a care in the world. I remember feeling like there was nothing bad or evil in the universe. I remember feeling like the entire universe was sending me good vibes. I remember feeling connected with every person that had ever rolled. I remember feeling in love with the 7 people in my rolling group, especially Ashley who I danced with for a lot of the night, and Justin because of his role (no pun intended) in bringing me to this wonderful place. I remember feeling in love with V and C. I remember being in love with everyone I knew.\n\nI remember other things too, but this is long enough already. Eventually the rave started to end and we left and returned home. I couldn't believe that I had spent almost 6 hours there, just dancing and feeling great. It felt like 15 minutes.\n\nI was still rolling, although I could tell that it was lessening, when I finally got back to my dorm. I looked at my eyes in the mirror and my pupils were incredibly dilated. I put on some music and had a one man dance party in my room. Eventually, I moved to my bed and just lay there, feeling the coolness of the AC, the softness of my sheets, and listening to the beautiful music. I lay there for a while before I eventually fell asleep.\n\nThe only negative effects the next day was the expected pain in my jaw from chewing gum way too hard all night and clenching my jaw. I'll have to invest in a mouthguard thingy next time. I was a little out of it all day, too. But no real hangover, which I was thankful for.\n\nI understand that people are cautious when it comes to certain drugs, and E is one of them. I can understand not wanting to try it because of worries about how it will affect you, not wanting to get addicted, not wanting to mess up your mind or whatever. That is all perfectly sound reasoning and I respect it. But it would make me happy if every person in my life that I loved tried E just once and had an experience as wonderful as mine. I want everyone I care about to feel as amazing as I did that night. I know this won't happen and can't happen, and I'm okay with that. But if I ever get a text from someone I know that reads like the ones I sent out that night ('Rolling. Rave. Love you.') then I will be incredibly happy.\n\n","Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 104th Congress, my fellow Americans: Again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy, and once again our democracy has spoken. So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress and congratulating you, Mr. Speaker.\nIf we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994. And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992.\nI must say that in both years we didn't hear America singing, we heard America shouting. And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must say, \"We hear you. We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us. For we are the keepers of a sacred trust, and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era.\"\nOver 200 years ago, our Founders changed the entire course of human history by joining together to create a new country based on a single powerful idea: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, . . . endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, and among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\nIt has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea, the American idea, and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times: to Lincoln and to his Congress to preserve the Union and to end slavery; to Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to restrain the abuses and excesses of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world; to Franklin Roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the Great Depression and to win our country's great struggle against fascism; and to all our Presidents since to fight the cold war. Especially, I recall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with Congresses where the majority was of a different party: to Harry Truman, who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the architecture of the cold war; and to Ronald Reagan, whom we wish well tonight and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against communism was won.\nIn another time of change and challenge, I had the honor to be the first President to be elected in the post-cold-war era, an era marked by the global economy, the information revolution, unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for the American people. I came to this hallowed Chamber 2 years ago on a mission, to restore the American dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world. I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored. In this effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes, and I have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor. But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was 2 years ago. Thank you.\nRecord numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global economy. We are at peace, and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world. We have almost 6 million new jobs since I became President, and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. Our businesses are more productive. And here we have worked to bring the deficit down, to expand trade, to put more police on our streets, to give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities.\nBut the rising tide is not lifting all boats. While our Nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our people are still working harder and harder, for less and less. While our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and competitive, too many of our people still can't be sure of having a job next year or even next month. And far more than our material riches are threatened, things far more precious to us, our children, our families, our values.\nOur civil life is suffering in America today. Citizens are working together less and shouting at each other more. The common bonds of community which have been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed. What are we to do about it?\nMore than 60 years ago, at the dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt told our Nation, \"New conditions impose new requirements on Government and those who conduct Government.\" And from that simple proposition, he shaped the New Deal, which helped to restore our Nation to prosperity and define the relationship between our people and their Government for half a century.\nThat approach worked in its time. But we today, we face a very different time and very different conditions. We are moving from an industrial age built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility. Our Government, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen by many as simply a captive of narrow interests, putting more burdens on our citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead. The values that used to hold us all together seem to be coming apart.\nSo tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of understandings, not just with Government but, even more important, with one another as Americans.\nThat's what I want to talk with you about tonight. I call it the New Covenant. But it's grounded in a very, very old idea, that all Americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their God-given talents and determination can take them and to give something back to their communities and their country in return. Opportunity and responsibility: They go hand in hand. We can't have one without the other. And our national community can't hold together without both.\nOur New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our people to meet the challenges of a new economy, how we can change the way our Government works to fit a different time, and, above all, how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common purpose. We must have dramatic change in our economy, our Government, and ourselves.\nMy fellow Americans, without regard to party, let us rise to the occasion. Let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride. As we embark on this new course, let us put our country first, remembering that regardless of party label, we are all Americans. And let the final test of everything we do be a simple one: Is it good for the American people?\nLet me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not better servants. You made a good start by passing that law which applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector, and I was proud to sign it yesterday. But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work around here. Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors of Washington as were here 20 years ago. The American people look at their Capital, and they see a city where the well-connected and the well-protected can work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left out.\nAs the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still doing business as usual; the gifts, the trips, all the things that people are concerned about haven't stopped. Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices. I know there were other considerations in those votes, but I want to use something that I've heard my Republican friends say from time to time, \"There doesn't have to be a law for everything.\" So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists' perks. Just stop. We don't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the American people that things are really changing. But I also hope you will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill, and I'll sign that, too.\nWe should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what they're spending, what they want. We should also curb the role of big money in elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of PAC's. And as I have said for 3 years, we should work to open the airwaves so that they can be an instrument of democracy, not a weapon of destruction, by giving free TV time to candidates for public office.\nWhen the last Congress killed political reform last year, it was reported in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the Halls of this sacred building and cheered. This year, let's give the folks at home something to cheer about.\nMore important, I think we all agree that we have to change the way the Government works. Let's make it smaller, less costly, and smarter; leaner, not meaner.\nI just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine is alive and well.\nThe New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter. The old way of governing around here protected organized interests. We should look out for the interests of ordinary people. The old way divided us by interest, constituency, or class. The New Covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of what's best for our country. The old way dispensed services through large, top-down, inflexible bureaucracies. The New Covenant way should shift these resources and decisionmaking from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy. The old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure. The New Covenant way should have built-in incentives to reward success. The old way was centralized here in Washington. The New Covenant way must take hold in the communities all across America. And we should help them to do that.\nOur job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy, to empower people to make the most of their own lives, and to enhance our security here at home and abroad. We must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves. We should rely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for each other.\nI hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters, we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is somehow a program for every problem, on the one hand, and the other illusion that the Government is a source of every problem we have. Our job is to get rid of yesterday's Government so that our own people can meet today's and tomorrow's needs. And we ought to do it together.\nYou know, for years before I became President, I heard others say they would cut Government and how bad it was, but not much happened. We actually did it. We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending, more than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions from the Federal bureaucracy in the last 2 years alone. Based on decisions already made, we will have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million positions from the Federal Government, making it the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was President, by the time I come here again next year.\nUnder the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have already saved taxpayers $63 billion. The age of the $500 hammer and the ashtray you can break on \"David Letterman\" is gone. Deadwood programs, like mohair subsidies, are gone. We've streamlined the Agriculture Department by reducing it by more than 1,200 offices. We've slashed the small business loan form from an inch thick to a single page. We've thrown away the Government's 10,000-page personnel manual.\nAnd the Government is working better in important ways: FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has gone from being a disaster to helping people in disasters. You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or the people in California who have dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires, and they'll tell you that. Government workers, working hand in hand with private business, rebuilt southern California's fractured freeways in record time and under budget. And because the Federal Government moved fast, all but one of the 5,600 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business.\nNow, there are a lot of other things that I could talk about. I want to just mention one because it will be discussed here in the next few weeks. University administrators all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable with better repayment terms for students, costs the Government less, and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the Government and for the universities. We shouldn't cap that program. We should give every college in America the opportunity to be a part of it.\nPrevious Government programs gathered dust. The reinventing Government report is getting results. And we're not through. There's going to be a second round of reinventing Government. We propose to cut $130 billion in spending by shrinking departments, extending our freeze on domestic spending, cutting 60 public housing programs down to 3, getting rid of over 100 programs we do not need, like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program. And we're working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more sensible. The programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should go. We have to cut yesterday's Government to help solve tomorrow's problems.\nAnd we need to get Government closer to the people it's meant to serve. We need to help move programs down to the point where States and communities and private citizens in the private sector can do a better job. If they can do it, we ought to let them do it. We should get out of the way and let them do what they can do better. Taking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for.\nIt's time for Congress to stop passing on to the States the cost of decisions we make here in Washington. I know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded mandates legislation, but I want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interests and give justified relief where we need to give it.\nFor years, Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending projects. Last year was no difference. There was a $1 million to study stress in plants and $12 million for a tick removal program that didn't work. It's hard to remove ticks. Those of us who have had them know. But I'll tell you something, if you'll give me line-item veto, I'll remove some of that unnecessary spending.\nBut I think we should all remember, and almost all of us would agree, that Government still has important responsibilities. Our young people—we should think of this when we cut—our young people hold our future in their hands. We still owe a debt to our veterans. And our senior citizens have made us what we are. Now, my budget cuts a lot. But it protects education, veterans, Social Security, and Medicare, and I hope you will do the same thing. You should, and I hope you will.\nAnd when we give more flexibility to the States, let us remember that there are certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every State, North and South, East and West: Immunization against childhood disease, school lunches in all our schools, Head Start, medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants, all these things, all these things are in the national interest.\nI applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations. But when we deregulate, let's remember what national action in the national interest has given us: safer food for our families, safer toys for our children, safer nursing homes for our parents, safer cars and highways, and safer workplaces, cleaner air, and cleaner water. Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations? You bet we do. But we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water. We can have fairness and still clean up toxic dumps, and we ought to do it.\nShould we cut the deficit more? Well, of course we should. Of course we should. But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic recovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished but instead should be helped.\nI know many of you in this Chamber support the balanced budget amendment. I certainly want to balance the budget. Our administration has done more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very, very long time. If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do, then you have to be straight with the American people. They have a right to know what you're going to cut, what taxes you're going to raise, and how it's going to affect them. We should be doing things in the open around here. For example, everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social Security. I would oppose that, and I think most Americans would.\nNothing has done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our failed welfare system. This is one of the problems we have to face here in Washington in our New Covenant. It rewards welfare over work. It undermines family values. It lets millions of parents get away without paying their child support. It keeps a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time.\nI've worked on this problem for a long time, nearly 15 years now. As a Governor, I had the honor of working with the Reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988. In the last 2 years, we made a good start at continuing the work of welfare reform. Our administration gave two dozen States the right to slash through Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency.\nLast year I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by an administration. We have to make welfare what it was meant to be, a second chance, not a way of life. We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible, to provide child care and teach them skills, if that's what they need, for up to 2 years. And after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule: Anyone who can work must go to work. If a parent isn't paying child support, they should be forced to pay. We should suspend drivers' license, track them across State lines, make them work off what they owe. That is what we should do. Governments do not raise children, people do. And the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world.\nI want to work with you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform. But our goal must be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to independence, from welfare to work, from mere childbearing to responsible parenting. Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor.\nWe should, we should require work and mutual responsibility. But we shouldn't cut people off just because they're poor, they're young, or even because they're unmarried. We should promote responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised settings, by requiring them to finish school. But we shouldn't put them and their children out on the street. And I know all the arguments, pro and con, and I have read and thought about this for a long time. I still don't think we can in good conscience punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.\nMy fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the American people care about this without regard to party or race or region. So let this be the year we end welfare as we know it. But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue to divide America. No one is more eager to end welfareI may be the only President who has actually had the opportunity to sit in a welfare office, who's actually spent hours and hours talking to people on welfare. And I am telling you, the people who are trapped on it know it doesn't work; they also want to get off. So we can promote, together, education and work and good parenting. I have no problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent. I just don't want to punish poverty and past mistakes. All of us have made our mistakes, and none of us can change our yesterdays. But every one of us can change our tomorrows. And America's best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey, who worked her way off welfare to become a Congresswoman from the State of California.\nI know the Members of this Congress are concerned about crime, as are all the citizens of our country. And I remind you that last year we passed a very tough crime bill: longer sentences, \"three strikes and you're out,\" almost 60 new capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention, 100,000 more police. And we paid for it all by reducing the size of the Federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower the crime rate.\nThere may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be smarter with crime, to help to lower that rate first. Well, if there are, let's talk about them, and let's do them. But let's not go back on the things that we did last year that we know work, that we know work because the local law enforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing, because local community leaders who have worked for years and years to lower the crime rate tell us that they work. Let's look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it. And if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate—and I am convinced that it does—let us not go back on it. Let's stick with it, implement it. We've got 4 more hard years of work to do to do that.\nI don't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight, but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly last year. The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and, in the crime bill, the ban on 19 assault weapons. I don't think it's a secret to anybody in this room that several Members of the last Congress who voted for that aren't here tonight because they voted for it. And I know, therefore, that some of you who are here because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it. I just have to tell you how I feel about it.\nThe Members of Congress who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activities. I've done it since I was a boy, and I'm going to keep right on doing it until I can't do it anymore. But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of assault weapon attack, and I will not let that be repealed. I will not let it be repealed.\nI'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with. I want us to cut more spending, but I hope we won't cut Government programs that help to prepare us for the new economy, promote responsibility, and are organized from the grassroots up, not by Federal bureaucracy. The very best example of this is the national service corps, AmeriCorps. It passed with strong bipartisan support. And now there are 20,000 Americans, more than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps, working all over this country, helping people person-to-person in local grassroots volunteer groups, solving problems, and in the process earning some money for their education. This is citizenship at its best. It's good for the AmeriCorps members, but it's good for the rest of us, too. It's the essence of the New Covenant, and we shouldn't stop it.\nAll Americans, not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens. In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.\nThe most important job of our Government in this new era is to empower the American people to succeed in the global economy. America has always been a land of opportunity, a land where, if you work hard, you can get ahead. We've become a great middle class country. Middle class values sustain us. We must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass, even as we do everything we can to support the millions of Americans who are already successful in the new economy.\nAmerica is once again the world's strongest economic power: almost 6 million new jobs in the last 2 years, exports booming, inflation down. High-wage jobs are coming back. A record number of American entrepreneurs are living the American dream. If we want it to stay that way, those who work and lift our Nation must have more of its benefits.\nToday, too many of those people are being left out. They're working harder for less. They have less security, less income, less certainty that they can even afford a vacation, much less college for their kids or retirement for themselves. We cannot let this continue. If we don't act, our economy will probably keep doing what it's been doing since about 1978, when the income growth began to go to those at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle got very little growth, and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then fell even further and further behind in the years afterward, no matter how hard they worked.\nWe've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this new economy work for all of our people, a Government that helps each and every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skills. That's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the last 2 years, from Head Start to public schools, to apprenticeships for young people who don't go to college, to making college loans more available and more affordable. That's the first thing we have to do. We've got to do something to empower people to improve their skills.\nThe second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes immediately by lowering their taxes. We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million families with incomes under $27,000, a tax cut that this year will average about $1,000 a family. And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses. Before we could do more than that, we first had to bring down the deficit we inherited, and we had to get economic growth up. Now we've done both. And now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way. But tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation: to empower our citizens through education and training to make the most of their own lives. The spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for themselves, their families, and their communities.\nI have proposed the middle class bill of rights, which should properly be called the bill of rights and responsibilities because its provisions only benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to educate themselves. It will, therefore, give needed tax relief and raise incomes in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefits all of us.\nThere are four provisions. First, a tax deduction for all education and training after high school. If you think about it, we permit businesses to deduct their investment, we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages, but today an education is even more important to the economic well-being of our whole country than even those things are. We should do everything we can to encourage it. And I hope you will support it. Second, we ought to cut taxes $500 for families with children under 13. Third, we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by permitting people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education, health care, first-time homebuying, or the care of a parent. And fourth, we should pass a GI bill for America's workers. We propose to collapse nearly 70 Federal programs and not give the money to the States but give the money directly to the American people, offer vouchers to them so that they, if they're laid off or if they're working for a very low wage, can get a voucher worth $2,600 a year for up to 2 years to go to their local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills they need to improve their lives. Let's empower people in this way, move it from the Government directly to the workers of America.\nNow, any one of us can call for a tax cut, but I won't accept one that explodes the deficit or puts our recovery at risk. We ought to pay for our tax cuts fully and honestly.\nJust 2 years ago, it was an open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit. Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then, many of whom didn't return, we did cut the deficit. We began to do what others said would not be done. We cut the deficit by over $600 billion, about $10,000 for every family in this country. It's coming down 3 years in a row for the first time since Mr. Truman was President, and I don't think anybody in America wants us to let it explode again.\nIn the budget I will send you, the middle class bill of rights is fully paid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy, cuts in programs, cuts in special interest subsidies. And the spending cuts will more than double the tax cuts. My budget pays for the middle class bill of rights without any cuts in Medicare. And I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with Medicare cuts. That's not the right thing to do.\nI know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief, and some of them I find quite interesting. I really want to work with all of you. My test for our proposals will be: Will it create jobs and raise incomes; will it strengthen our families and support our children; is it paid for; will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass? If it does, I'll support it. But if it doesn't, I won't.\nThe goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is also why I believe that you should raise the minimum wage. It rewards work. Two and a half million Americans, two and a half million Americans, often women with children, are working out there today for $4.25 an hour. In terms of real buying power, by next year that minimum wage will be at a 40-year low. That's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work.\nNow, I've studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum wage increase. I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market. But the most important thing is, you can't make a living on $4.25 an hour, especially if you have children, even with the working families tax cut we passed last year. In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue, and I think it should be again. So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on this, to get together, to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage.\nMembers of Congress have been here less than a month, but by the end of the week, 28 days into the new year, every Member of Congress will have earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker makes all year long.\nEverybody else here, including the President, has something else that too many Americans do without, and that's health care. Now, last year we almost came to blows over health care, but we didn't do anything. And the cold, hard fact is that, since last year, since I was here, another 1.1 million Americans in working families have lost their health care. And the cold, hard fact is that many millions more, most of them farmers and small business people and self-employed people, have seen their premiums skyrocket, their copays and deductibles go up. There's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have health insurance but really what they've got is a piece of paper that says they won't lose their home if they get sick.\nNow, I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health security for every American family. But I know that last year, as the evidence indicates, we bit off more than we could chew. So I'm asking you that we work together. Let's do it step by step. Let's do whatever we have to do to get something done. Let's at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage for facing skyrocketing prices, that nobody loses their coverage because they face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or lose a job or a family member gets sick.\nI want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this, with the Democrats who worked on it last time, with the Republican leaders like Senator Dole, who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made some constructive proposals in this area last year. We ought to make sure that self-employed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools. We ought to help families provide long-term care for a sick parent or a disabled child. We can work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work. And we can find a way—it may take some time, but we can find a way—to make sure that our children have health care.\nYou know, I think everybody in this room, without regard to party, can be proud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world's most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade. But we can't be proud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the world that has a smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health insurance today than we did 10 years ago, the last time we were the most productive economy in the world. So let's work together on this. It is too important for politics as usual.\nMuch of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we've already talked about. A lot of people think that the security concerns of America today are entirely internal to our borders. They relate to the security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children, our streets, our health, and protecting those borders. Now that the cold war has passed, it's tempting to believe that all the security issues, with the possible exception of trade, reside here at home. But it's not so. Our security still depends upon our continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy. We still can't be strong at home unless we're strong abroad.\nThe financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point. I know it's not popular to say it tonight, but we have to act, not for the Mexican people but for the sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to Mexico's well-being. If we want to secure American jobs, preserve American exports, safeguard America's borders, then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put Mexico back on track.\nNow let me repeat: It's not a loan; it's not foreign aid; it's not a bailout. We will be given a guarantee like cosigning a note, with good collateral that will cover our risks. This legislation is the right thing for America. That's why the bipartisan leadership has supported it. And I hope you in Congress will pass it quickly. It is in our interest, and we can explain it to the American people because we're going to do it in the right way.\nYou know, tonight, this is the first State of the Union Address ever delivered since the beginning of the cold war when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America. And along with the Russians, we're on our way to destroying the missiles and the bombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads. We've come so far so fast in this post-cold-war world that it's easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for granted. But it's still there, and we aren't finished yet.\nThis year I'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons that carry 5,000 more warheads. The United States will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical weapons. To stop and roll back North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear program, we'll continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation. It's smart. It's tough. It's a deal based on continuing inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves.\nThis year I'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home or abroad. As the cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out, this country will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice.\nJust this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and injured scores more. On behalf of the American people and all of you, I send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in the face of such evil, it is hard for the people in the Middle East to go forward. But the terrorists represent the past, not the future. We must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors in the Middle East.\nAccordingly, last night I signed an Executive order that will block the assets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the peace process. It prohibits financial transactions with these groups. And tonight I call on all our allies and peace-loving nations throughout the world to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism. We cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and paralysis.\nFrom the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our Nation would maintain the best equipped, best trained, and best prepared military on Earth. We have, and they are. They have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit. But to make sure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their families deserve, I'm asking the Congress to add $25 billion in defense spending over the next 6 years.\nI have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became President. Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction. We ask a very great deal of our Armed Forces. Now that they are smaller in number, we ask more of them. They go out more often to more different places and stay longer. They are called to service in many, many ways. And we must give them and their families what the times demand and what they have earned.\nJust think about what our troops have done in the last year, showing America at its best, helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda, moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait, giving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti. We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South Africa to Northern Ireland, from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia, from Latin America to the Middle East. All these endeavors are good in those places, but they make our future more confident and more secure.\nWell, my fellow Americans, that's my agenda for America's future: expanding opportunity, not bureaucracy; enhancing security at home and abroad; empowering our people to make the most of their own lives. It's ambitious and achievable, but it's not enough. We even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping Americans to compete in the new economy, more than a Government that's smaller, smarter, and wiser, more than all of the changes we can make in Government and in the private sector from the outside in.\nOur fortunes and our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer some questions from within, from the values and voices that speak to our hearts as well as our heads; voices that tell us we have to do more to accept responsibility for ourselves and our families, for our communities, and yes, for our fellow citizens. We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart, and we feel the common ground shifting from under us. The PTA, the town hall meeting, the ball park, it's hard for a lot of overworked parents to find the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation. Too many of our children don't even have parents and grandparents who can give them those experiences that they need to build their own character and their sense of identity.\nWe all know what while we here in this Chamber can make a difference on those things, that the real differences will be made by our fellow citizens, where they work and where they live and that it will be made almost without regard to party. When I used to go to the softball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter's league, and people would come up to me, fathers and mothers, and talk to me, I can honestly say I had no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or Democrats. When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California, northern California, last week, a woman came up to me and did something that very few of you would do. She hugged me and said, \"Mr. President, I'm a Republican, but I'm glad you're here.\"\nNow, why? We can't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every day, because as we move into this next century, everybody matters. We don't have a person to waste. And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to do better. That means that we need a New Covenant for everybody.\nFor our corporate and business leaders, we're going to work here to keep bringing the deficit down, to expand markets, to support their success in every possible way. But they have an obligation when they're doing well to keep jobs in our communities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate.\nFor people in the entertainment industry in this country, we applaud your creativity and your worldwide success, and we support your freedom of expression. But you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant, repetitive, mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media all the time.\nWe've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to help us stop our most serious social problem, the epidemic of teen pregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I have sent to Congress a plan to target schools all over this country with antipregnancy programs that work. But Government can only do so much. Tonight I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference. We can do this, and we must.\nAnd I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders. You know, I'm proud of the fact the United States has more houses of worship per capita than any country in the world. These people who lead our houses of worship can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action, can reach out to all of our children, to all of the people in distress, to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear. Because so much of what must be done must come from the inside out and our religious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference, they have a role in the New Covenant as well.\nThere must be more responsibility for all of our citizens. You know, it takes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets and in school. It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity houses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin. It takes a lot of people to provide the people power for all of the civic organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were kids. It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be.\nI know it's hard when you're working harder for less, when you're under great stress to do these things. A lot of our people don't have the time or the emotional stress, they think, to do the work of citizenship.\nMost of us in politics haven't helped very much. For years, we've mostly treated citizens like they were consumers or spectators, sort of political couch potatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads either promise them something for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations. And more and more of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive ways that are hardly conducive to honest and open conversations. But the truth is, we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different views.\nIf you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of America, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago, has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And in this day, everybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply cannot want for a tornado, a fire, or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another.\nI want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the First Lady that represent what I'm trying to talk about—citizens. I have no idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last election. But they represent what we ought to be doing.\nCindy Perry teaches second graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural Kentucky. She gains when she gives. She's a mother of four. She says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency last year. She was married when she was a teenager—stand up, Cindy. She was married when she was a teenager. She had four children. But she had time to serve other people, to get her high school equivalency, and she's going to use her AmeriCorps money to go back to college.\nChief Stephen Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City. He's been a national leader—stand up, Steve. He's been a national leader in using more police in community policing, and he's worked with AmeriCorps to do it. And the crime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he did.\nCorporal Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country's force to help secure democracy in his native land. And I might add, we must be the only country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken Haitian-Americans there who could speak the language and talk to the people. And he was one of them, and we're proud of him.\nThe next two folks I've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a little bit, the Reverend John and the Reverend Diana Cherry of the AME Zion Church in Temple Hills, Maryland. I'd like to ask them to stand. I want to tell you about them. In the early eighties, they left Government service and formed a church in a small living room in a small house, in the early eighties. Today that church has 17,000 members. It is one of the three or four biggest churches in the entire United States. It grows by 200 a month. They do it together. And the special focus of their ministry is keeping families together.\nTwo things they did make a big impression on me. I visited their church once, and I learned they were building a new sanctuary closer to the Washington, DC, line in a higher crime, higher drug rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them. The second thing I want to say is that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House with some other religious leaders, and he left early to go back to this church to minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all over America to convince them to come back together, to save their marriages, and to raise their kids. This is the kind of work that citizens are doing in America. We need more of it, and it ought to be lifted up and supported.\nThe last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Jack, would you stand up? Fifty years ago, in the sands of Iwo Jima, Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship. On February 20th, 1945, he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them. In that moment, he saved the lives of his companions, and miraculously in the next instant, a medic saved his life. He gained a foothold for freedom, and at the age of 17, just a year older than his grandson who is up there with him today—and his son, who is a West Point graduate and a veteran—at 17, Jack Lucas became the youngest Marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor. All these years later, yesterday, here's what he said about that day: \"It didn't matter where you were from or who you were, you relied on one another. You did it for your country.\"\nWe all gain when we give, and we reap what we sow. That's at the heart of this New Covenant. Responsibility, opportunity, and citizenship, more than stale chapters in some remote civic book, they're still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the enduring dream from that first and most sacred covenant. I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our Creator the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This is a very, very great country. And our best days are still to come.\nThank you, and God bless you all.\n","So long ago, certain place, certain time, you touched my hand.\nAll the way down to Emmiline, but if our paths never cross, well you know I'm sorry but if I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.\nI'll never live to match the beauty again, the rainbow's end.\n\nSo it's hard to find someone with that kind of intensity.\nYou touched my hand I played it cool.\n\nSo long ago, it's a certain time, it's a certain place.\nYou touched my hand and you smiled all the way back you held out your hand.\nIf I hope and I pray, ooh it might work out someday.\nIf I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.\nI'll never live to match the beauty again.\n\n","My name is Jonas, I'm carrying the wheel.\nThanks for all you've shown us, but this is how we feel.\nCome sit next to me, pour yourself some tea.\nJust like grandma made, when we couldn't find sleep.\nThings were better then - once but never again.\nWe've all left the den.

(Since the 18th century, the term \"novella\", or \"novelle\" in German, has been used in English and other European languages to describe a long short story or a short novel.)\n\nMurasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji, an early 11th-century Japanese text, has sometimes been described as the world's first novel, but there is considerable debate over this — there were certainly long fictional works much earlier. Spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of classical Chinese novels by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Parallel European developments occurred after the invention of the printing press. Miguel de Cervantes, author of Don Quixote (the first part of which was published in 1605), is frequently cited as the first significant European novelist of the modern era. Ian Watt, in The Rise of the Novel (1957), suggested that the modern novel was born in the early 18th century.\n\nWalter Scott made a distinction between the novel, in which (as he saw it) \"events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society\" and the romance, which he defined as \"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents\". However, many such romances, including the historical romances of Scott, Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights and Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a \"kindred term\". This sort of romance is in turn different from the genre fiction love romance or romance novel. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: \"a novel is le roman, der Roman, il romanzo, en roman.\"\n\nA novel is a long, fictional narrative which describes intimate human experiences. The novel in the modern era usually makes use of a literary prose style. The development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in printing, and the introduction of cheap paper in the 15th century.\n\nThe present English (and Spanish) word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian novella for \"new\", \"news\", or \"short story of something new\", itself from the Latin novella, a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning \"new\". Most European languages use the word \"romance\" (as in French, Dutch, Russian, Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, Romanian, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian \"roman\"; Finnish \"romaani\"; German \"Roman\"; Portuguese \"romance\" and Italian \"romanzo\") for extended narratives. * A fictional narrative Fictionality is most commonly cited as distinguishing novels from historiography. However this can be a problematic criterion. Throughout the early modern period authors of historical narratives would often include inventions rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of text or add credibility to an opinion. Historians would also invent and compose speeches for didactic purposes. Novels can, on the other hand, depict the social, political and personal realities of a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works of history. * Literary prose While prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel, the ancestors of the modern European novel include verse epics in the Romance language of southern France, especially those by Chrétien de Troyes (late 12th century), and in Middle English (Geoffrey Chaucer's (c. 1343 – 1400) The Canterbury Tales). Even in the 19th century, fictional narratives in verse, such as Lord Byron's Don Juan (1824), Alexander Pushkin's Yevgeniy Onegin (1833), and Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Aurora Leigh (1856), competed with prose novels. Vikram Seth's The Golden Gate (1986), composed of 590 Onegin stanzas, is a more recent example of the verse novel. * Content: intimate experience Both in 12th-century Japan and 15th-century Europe, prose fiction created intimate reading situations. On the other hand, verse epics, including the Odyssey and Aeneid, had been recited to a select audiences, though this was a more intimate experience than the performance of plays in theaters. A new world of individualistic fashion, personal views, intimate feelings, secret anxieties, \"conduct\", and \"gallantry\" spread with novels and the associated prose-romance. * Length The novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose fiction, followed by the novella. However, in the 17th century, critics saw the romance as of epic length and the novel as its short rival. A precise definition of the differences in length between these types of fiction, is, however, not possible.The requirement of length has been traditionally connected with the notion that a novel should encompass the \"totality of life.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough early forms of the novel are to be found in a number of places, including classical Rome, 10th– and 11th-century Japan, and Elizabethan England, the European novel is often said to have begun with Don Quixote in 1605.\n\nEarly works of extended fictional prose, or novels, include works in Latin like the Satyricon by Petronius (c. 50 AD), and The Golden Ass by Apuleius (c. 150 AD), works in Ancient Greek such as Daphnis and Chloe by Longus (c. late second century AD), A True Story by Lucian of Samosata (2nd century), or Aethiopica (3rd century), works in Sanskrit such as the 4th or 5th century Vasavadatta by Subandhu, 6th– or 7th-century Daśakumāracarita and Avantisundarīkathā  by Daṇḍin, and in the 7th-century Kadambari by Banabhatta, Murasaki Shikibu's 11th-century Japanese work The Tale of Genji, the 12th-century Hayy ibn Yaqdhan (or Philosophus Autodidactus, the 17th-century Latin title) by Ibn Tufail, who wrote in Arabic, the 13th-century Theologus Autodidactus by Ibn al-Nafis, another Arabic novelist, and Blanquerna, written in Catalan by Ramon Llull (1283), and the 14th-century Chinese Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong.\n\nMurasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji (1010) has been described as the world's first novel and shows essentially all the qualities for which Marie de La Fayette's novel La Princesse de Clèves (1678) has been praised: individuality of perception, an interest in character development, and psychological observation. Urbanization and the spread of printed books in Song Dynasty (960–1279) China led to the evolution of oral storytelling into fictional novels by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Parallel European developments did not occur until after the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439, and the rise of the publishing industry over a century later allowed for similar opportunities.\n\nBy contrast, Ibn Tufail's Hayy ibn Yaqdhan and Ibn al-Nafis' Theologus Autodidactus are works of didactic philosophy and theology. In this sense, Hayy ibn Yaqdhan would be considered an early example of a philosophical novel, while Theologus Autodidactus would be considered an early theological novel. Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, with its story of a human outcast surviving on an island, is also likely to have influenced Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719), because the work was available in an English edition in 1711.\n\nEpic poetry exhibits some similarities with the novel, and the Western tradition of the novel reaches back into the field of verse epics, though again not in an unbroken tradition. The epics of Asia, such as the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh (1300–1000 BC), and Indian epics such as the Ramayana (400 BCE and 200 CE), and Mahabharata (4th century BC) were as unknown in early modern Europe as was the Anglo-Saxon epic of Beowulf (c. 750–1000 AD), which was rediscovered in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Other non-European works, such as the Torah, the Koran, and the Bible, are full of stories, and thus have also had a significant influence on the development of prose narratives, and therefore the novel. Then at the beginning of the 18th century, French prose translations brought Homer's works to a wider public, who accepted them as forerunners of the novel.\n\nClassical Greek and Roman prose narratives included a didactic strand, with the philosopher Plato's (c. 425 – c. 348 BC) dialogues; a satirical dimension with Petronius' Satyricon; the incredible stories of Lucian of Samosata; and Lucius Apuleius' proto-picaresque The Golden Ass, as well as the heroic romances of the Greeks Heliodorus and Longus. Longus is the author of the Greek novel, Daphnis and Chloe (2nd century AD).\n\n\n\nRomance or chivalric romance is a type of narrative in prose or verse popular in the aristocratic circles of High Medieval and Early Modern Europe. They were marvel-filled adventures, often of a knight-errant with heroic qualities, who undertakes a quest, yet it is \"the emphasis on heterosexual love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the chanson de geste and other kinds of epic, which involve heroism.\" In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of courtly love.\n\nOriginally, romance literature was written in Old French, Anglo-Norman and Occitan, later, in English, Italian and German. During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose.\n\nThe shift from verse to prose dates from the early 13th century. The Prose Lancelot or Vulgate Cycle includes passages from that period. This collection indirectly led to Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur of the early 1470s. Prose became increasingly attractive because it enabled writers to associate popular stories with serious histories traditionally composed in prose, and could also be more easily translated.\n\nPopular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with ironic, satiric or burlesque intent. Romances reworked legends, fairy tales, and history, but by about 1600 they were out of fashion, and Miguel de Cervantes famously burlesqued them in Don Quixote (1605). Still, the modern image of the medieval is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word \"medieval\" evokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and such tropes.\n\nAround 1800, the connotations of \"romance\" were modified with the development Gothic fiction.\n\nThe term \"novel\" originates from the production of short stories, or novella that remained part of a European oral culture of storytelling into the late 19th century. Fairy tales, jokes, and humorous stories designed to make a point in a conversation, and the exemplum a priest would insert in a sermon belong into this tradition. Written collections of such stories circulated in a wide range of products from practical compilations of examples designed for the use of clerics to compilations of various stories such as Boccaccio's Decameron (1354) and Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (1386–1400). The Decameron (1354) was a compilation of one hundred novelle told by ten people—seven women and three men—fleeing the Black Death by escaping from Florence to the Fiesole hills, in 1348.\n\n\n\nThe modern distinction between history and fiction did not exist in the early sixteenth century and the grossest improbabilities pervade many historical accounts found in the early modern print market. William Caxton's 1485 edition of Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (1471) was sold as a true history, though the story unfolded in a series of magical incidents and historical improbabilities. Sir John Mandeville's Voyages, written in the 14th century, but circulated in printed editions throughout the 18th century, was filled with natural wonders, which were accepted as fact, like the one-footed Ethiopians who use their extremity as an umbrella against the desert sun. Both works eventually came to be viewed as works of fiction.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries two factors led to the separation of history and fiction. The invention of printing immediately created a new market of comparatively cheap entertainment and knowledge in the form of chapbooks. The more elegant production of this genre by 17th- and 18th-century authors were belles lettres—that is, a market that would be neither low nor academic. The second major development was the first best-seller of modern fiction, the Spanish Amadis de Gaula, by García Montalvo. However, it was not accepted as an example of belles lettres. The Amadis eventually became the archetypical romance, in contrast with the modern novel which began to be developed in the 17th century.\n\nA chapbook is an early type of popular literature printed in early modern Europe. Produced cheaply, chapbooks were commonly small, paper-covered booklets, usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages. They were often illustrated with crude woodcuts, which sometimes bore no relation to the text. When illustrations were included in chapbooks, they were considered popular prints. The tradition arose in the 16th century, as soon as printed books became affordable, and rose to its height during the 17th and 18th centuries and Many different kinds of ephemera and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as almanacs, children's literature, folk tales, nursery rhymes, pamphlets, poetry, and political and religious tracts.\n\nThe term \"chapbook\" for this type of literature was coined in the 19th century. The corresponding French and German terms are bibliothèque bleue (blue book) and Volksbuch, respectively. The principal historical subject matter of chapbooks was abridgements of ancient historians, popular medieval histories of knights, stories of comical heroes, religious legends, and collections of jests and fables. The new printed books reached the households of urban citizens and country merchants who visited the cities as traders. Cheap printed histories were, in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially popular among apprentices and younger urban readers of both sexes.\n\nThe early modern market, from the 1530s and 1540s, divided into low chapbooks and high market expensive, fashionable, elegant belles lettres. The Amadis and Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel were important publications with respect to this divide. Both books specifically addressed the new customers of popular histories, rather than readers of belles lettres. The Amadis was a multi–volume fictional history of style, that aroused a debate about style and elegance as it became the first best-seller of popular fiction. On the other hand, Gargantua and Pantagruel, while it adopted the form of modern popular history, in fact satirized that genre's stylistic achievements. The division, between low and high literature, became especially visible with books that appeared on both the popular and belles lettres markets in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries: low chapbooks included abridgments of books such as Miguel Cervantes' Don Quixote (1605/1615)\n\nThe term \"chapbook\" is also in use for present-day publications, commonly short, inexpensive booklets.\n\nHeroic Romance is a genre of imaginative literature, which flourished in the 17th century, principally in France.\n\nThe beginnings of modern fiction in France took a pseudo-bucolic form, and the celebrated L'Astrée, (1610) of Honore d'Urfe (1568–1625), which is the earliest French novel, is properly styled a pastoral. Although its action was, in the main, languid and sentimental, there was a side of the Astree which encouraged that extravagant love of glory, that spirit of \" panache\", which was now rising to its height in France. That spirit it was which animated Marin le Roy de Gomberville (1603–1674), who was the inventor of what have since been known as the Heroical Romances. In these there was experienced a violent recrudescence of the old medieval elements of romance, the impossible valour devoted to a pursuit of the impossible beauty, but the whole clothed in the language and feeling and atmosphere of the age in which the books were written. In order to give point to the chivalrous actions of the heroes, it was always hinted that they were well-known public characters of the day in a romantic disguise.\n\nStories of witty cheats were an integral part of the European novella with its tradition of fabliaux. Significant examples include Till Eulenspiegel (1510), Lazarillo de Tormes (1554), Grimmelshausen's Simplicissimus Teutsch (1666–1668) and in England Richard Head's The English Rogue (1665). The tradition that developed with these titles focused on a hero and his life. The adventures led to satirical encounters with the real world with the hero either becoming the pitiable victim or the rogue who exploited the vices of those he met.\n\nA second tradition of satirical romances can be traced back to Heinrich Wittenwiler's Ring (c. 1410) and to François Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel (1532–1564), which parodied and satirized heroic romances, and did this mostly by dragging them into the low realm of the burlesque. Cervantes' Don Quixote (1606/1615) modified the satire of romances: its hero lost contact with reality by reading too many romances in the Amadisian tradition.\n\nOther important works of the tradition are Paul Scarron's Roman Comique (1651–57), the anonymous French Rozelli with its satire on Europe's religions, Alain-René Lesage's Gil Blas (1715–1735), Henry Fielding's Joseph Andrews (1742) and Tom Jones (1749), and Denis Diderot's Jacques the Fatalist (1773, printed posthumously in 1796).\n\nA market of literature in the modern sense of the word, that is a separate market for fiction and poetry, did not exist until the late seventeenth century. All books were sold under the rubric of \"History and politicks\" in the early 18th century, including pamphlets, memoirs, travel literature, political analysis, serious histories, romances, poetry, and novels.\n\nThat fictional histories shared the same space with academic histories and modern journalism had been criticized by historians since the end of the Middle Ages: fictions were \"lies\" and therefore hardly justifiable at all. The climate, however, changed in the 1670s.\n\nThe romance format of the quasi–historical works of Madame d'Aulnoy, César Vichard de Saint-Réal, Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras, and Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer, allowed the publication of histories that dared not risk an unambiguous assertion of their truth. The literary market-place of the late 17th and early 18th century employed a simple pattern of options whereby fictions could reach out into the sphere of true histories. This permitted its authors to claim they had published fiction, not truth, if they ever faced allegations of libel.\n\nPrefaces and title pages of 17th– and early 18th-century fiction acknowledged this pattern: histories could claim to be romances, but threaten to relate true events, as in the Roman à clef. Other works could, conversely, claim to be factual histories, yet earn the suspicion that they were wholly invented. A further differentiation was made between private and public history: Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe was, within this pattern, neither a \"romance\" nor a \"novel\". It smelled of romance, yet the preface stated that it should most certainly be read as a true private history.\n\nThe rise of the novel as an alternative to the romance began with the publication of Cervantes' Novelas Exemplares (1613). It continued with Scarron's Roman Comique (the first part of which appeared in 1651), whose heroes noted the rivalry between French romances and the new Spanish genre.\n\nLate 17th-century critics looked back on the history of prose fiction, proud of the generic shift that had taken place, leading towards the modern novel/novella. The first perfect works in French were those of Scarron and Madame de La Fayette's \"Spanish history\" Zayde (1670). The development finally led to her Princesse de Clèves (1678), the first novel with what would become characteristic French subject matter.\n\nEurope witnessed the generic shift in the titles of works in French published in Holland, which supplied the international market and English publishers exploited the novel/romance controversy in the 1670s and 1680s. Contemporary critics listed the advantages of the new genre: brevity, a lack of ambition to produce epic poetry in prose; the style was fresh and plain; the focus was on modern life, and on heroes who were neither good nor bad. The novel's potential to become the medium of urban gossip and scandal fuelled the rise of the novel/novella. Stories were offered as allegedly true recent histories, not for the sake of scandal but strictly for the moral lessons they gave. To prove this, fictionalized names were used with the true names in a separate key. The Mercure Gallant set the fashion in the 1670s. Collections of letters and memoirs appeared, and were filled with the intriguing new subject matter and the epistolary novel grew from this and led to the first full blown example of scandalous fiction in Aphra Behn's Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister (1684/ 1685/ 1687). Before the rise of the literary novel, reading novels had only been a form of entertainment.\n\nHowever, one of the earliest English novels, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719), has elements of the romance, unlike these novels, because of its exotic setting and story of survival in isolation. Crusoe lacks almost all of the elements found in these new novels: wit, a fast narration evolving around a group of young fashionable urban heroes, along with their intrigues, a scandalous moral, gallant talk to be imitated, and a brief, concise plot. The new developments did, however, lead to Eliza Haywood's epic length novel, Love in Excess (1719/20) and to Samuel Richardson's Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (1741). Some literary historians date the beginning of the English novel with Richardson's Pamela, rather than Crusoe.\n\nThe idea of the \"rise of the novel\" in the 18th century is especially associated with Ian Watt's influential study The Rise of the Novel (1957). In Watt's conception, a rise in fictional realism during the 18th century came to distinguish the novel from earlier prose narratives.\n\n\n\nThe rising status of the novel in 18th-century can be seen in the development of philosophical and experimental novels.\n\nPhilosophical fiction was not exactly new. Plato's dialogues were embedded in fictional narratives and his Republic is an early example of a Utopia. The tradition of works of fiction that were also philosophical texts continued with Thomas More's Utopia (1516) and Tommaso Campanella's City of the Sun (1602). However, the actual tradition of the philosophical novel came into being in the 1740s with new editions of More's work under the title Utopia: or the happy republic; a philosophical romance (1743). Voltaire wrote in this genre in Micromegas: a comic romance, which is a biting satire on philosophy, ignorance, and the self-conceit of mankind (1752, English 1753). His Zadig (1747) and Candide (1759) became central texts of the French Enlightenment and of the modern novel.\n\nAn example of the experimental novel is Laurence Sterne's The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759–1767), with its rejection of continuous narration. In it the author not only addresses readers in his preface but speaks directly to them in his fictional narrative. In addition to Sterne's narrative experiments, there has visual experiments, such as a marbled page, a black page to express sorrow, and a page of lines to show the plot lines of the book. The novel as a whole focuses on the problems of language, with constant regard to John Locke's theories in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.\n\n\n\nThe rise of the word novel at the cost of its rival, the romance, remained a Spanish and English phenomenon, and though readers all over Western Europe had welcomed the novel(la) or short history as an alternative in the second half of the 17th century, only the English and the Spanish had, however, openly discredited the romance.\n\nBut the change of taste was brief and Fénelon's Telemachus (1699/1700) already exploited a nostalgia for the old romances with their heroism and professed virtue. Jane Barker explicitly advertised her Exilius as \"A new Romance\", \"written after the Manner of Telemachus\", in 1715. Robinson Crusoe spoke of his own story as a \"romance\", though in the preface to the third volume, published in 1720, Defoe attacks all who said \"that [...] the Story is feign'd, that the Names are borrow'd, and that it is all a Romance; that there never were any such Man or Place\".\n\nThe late 18th century brought an answer with the Romantic Movement's readiness to reclaim the word romance, with the gothic romance, and the historical novels of Walter Scott. Robinson Crusoe now became a \"novel\" in this period, that is a work of the new realistic fiction created in the 18th century.\n\nSentimental novels relied on emotional responses, and feature scenes of distress and tenderness, and the plot is arranged to advance emotions rather than action. The result is a valorization of \"fine feeling\", displaying the characters as models of refined, sensitive emotional effect. The ability to display such feelings was thought at this time to show character and experience, and to help shape positive social life and relationships.\n\nAn example of this genre is Samuel Richardson's Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (1740), composed \"to cultivate the Principles of Virtue and Religion in the Minds of the Youth of Both Sexes\", which focuses on a potential victim, a heroine that has all the modern virtues and who is vulnerable because her low social status and her occupation as servant of a libertine who falls in love with her. She, however, ends in reforming her antagonist.\n\nMale heroes adopted the new sentimental character traits in the 1760s. Laurence Sterne's Yorick, the hero of the Sentimental Journey (1768) did so with an enormous amount of humour. Oliver Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield (1766) and Henry Mackenzie's Man of Feeling (1771) produced the far more serious role models.\n\nThese works inspired a sub- and counterculture of pornographic novels, for which Greek and Latin authors in translations had provided elegant models from the last century. Pornography includes John Cleland's Fanny Hill (1748), which offered an almost exact reversals of the plot of novel's that emphasised virtue. The prostitute Fanny Hill learns to enjoy her work and establishes herself as a free and economically independent individual, in editions one could only expect to buy under the counter.\n\nLess virtuous protagonists can also be found in satirical novels, like Richard Head's English Rogue (1665), that feature brothels, while women authors like Aphra Behn had offered their heroines alternative careers as precursors of the 19th-century femmes fatales. >\n\nThe genre evolves in the 1770s with, for example, Werther in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774) realising that it is impossible for him to integrate into the new conformist society, and Pierre Choderlos de Laclos in Les Liaisons dangereuses (1782) showing a group of aristocrats playing games of intrigue and amorality..\n\n\n\nBy around 1700, fiction was no longer a predominantly aristocratic entertainment, and printed books had soon gained the power to reach readers of almost all classes, though the reading habits differed and to follow fashions remained a privilege. Spain was a trendsetter into the 1630s but French authors superseded Cervantes, de Quevedo, and Alemán in the 1640s. As Huet was to note in 1670, the change was one of manners. The new French works taught a new, on the surface freer, gallant exchange between the sexes as the essence of life at the French court.\n\nThe situation changed again from 1660s into the 1690s when works by French authors were published in Holland out of the reach of French censors. Dutch publishing houses pirated of fashionable books from France and created a new market of political and scandalous fiction. This led to a market of European rather than French fashions in the early 18th century.\n\nBy the 1680s fashionable political European novels had inspired a second wave of private scandalous publications and generated new productions of local importance. Women authors reported on politics and on their private love affairs in The Hague and in London. German students imitated them to boast of their private amours in fiction. The London, the anonymous international market of the Netherlands, publishers in Hamburg and Leipzig generated new public spheres. Once private individuals, such as students in university towns and daughters of London's upper class began write novels based on questionable reputations, the public began to call for a reformation of manners.\n\nAn important development in Britain, at the beginning of the century, was that new journals like The Spectator and The Tatler reviewed novels. In Germany Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's Briefe, die neuste Literatur betreffend (1758) appeared in the middle of the century with reviews of art and fiction. By the 1780s such reviews played had an important role in introducing new works of fiction to the public.\n\nInfluenced by the new journals, reform became the main goal of the second generation of 18th-century novelists. The Spectator Number 10 had stated that the aim was now \"to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality […] to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses\"). Constructive criticism of novels had until then been rare. The first treatise on the history of the novel was a preface to Marie de La Fayette's novel Zayde (1670).\n\nA much later development was the introduction of novels into school and later university curricula.\n\nThe French churchman and scholar Pierre Daniel Huet's Traitté de l'origine des romans (1670) laid the ground for a greater acceptance of the novel as literature, that is comparable to the classics, in the early 18th century. The theologian had not only dared to praise fictions, but he had also explained techniques of theological interpretation of fiction, which was a novelty. Furthermore, readers of novels and romances could gain insight not only into their own culture, but also that of distant, exotic countries.\n\nWhen the decades around 1700 saw the appearance of new editions of the classical authors Petronius, Lucian, and Heliodorus of Emesa. the publishers equipped them with prefaces that referred to Huet's treatise. and the canon it had established. Also exotic works of Middle Eastern fiction entered the market that gave insight into Islamic culture. The Book of One Thousand and One Nights was first published in Europe from 1704 to 1715 in French, and then translated immediately into English and German, and was seen as a contribution to Huet's history of romances.\n\nThe English, Select Collection of Novels in six volumes (1720–22), is a milestone in this development of the novel's prestige. It included Huet's Treatise, along with the European tradition of the modern novel of the day: that is, novella from Machiavelli's to Marie de La Fayette's masterpieces. Aphra Behn's novels had appeared in the 1680s but became classics when reprinted in collections. Fénelon's Telemachus (1699/1700) became a classic three years after its publication. New authors entering the market were now ready to use their personal names rather than pseudonyms, including Eliza Haywood, who in 1719 following in the footsteps of Aphra Behn used her name with unprecedented pride.\n\n\n\nThe very word romanticism is connected to the idea of romance, and the romance genre experienced a revival, at the end of the 18th century, with gothic fiction, that began in 1746 with English author Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, subtitled (in its second edition) \"A Gothic Story\". Other important works are Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) and 'Monk' Lewis's The Monk (1795).\n\nThe new romances challenged the idea that the novel involved a realistic depictions of life, and destabilized the difference the critics had been trying to establish, between serious classical art and popular fiction. Gothic romances exploited the grotesque, and some critics thought that their subject matter deserved less credit than the worst medieval tales of Arthurian knighthood.\n\nThe authors of this new type of fiction were accused of exploiting all available topics to thrill, arouse, or horrify their audience. These new romantic novelists, however, claimed that they were exploring the entire realm of fictionality. And psychological interpreters, in the early 19th century, read these works as encounters with the deeper hidden truth of the human imagination: this included sexuality, anxieties, and insatiable desires. Under such readings, novels were described as exploring deeper human motives, and it was suggested that such artistic freedom would reveal what had not previously been openly visible.\n\nThe romances of de Sade, Les 120 Journées de Sodome (1785), Poe's Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque (1840), Mary Shelley, Frankenstein (1818), and E.T.A. Hoffmann, Die Elixiere des Teufels (1815), would later attract 20th-century psychoanalysts and supply the images for 20th- and 21st-century horror films, love romances, fantasy novels, role-playing computer games, and the surrealists.\n\nThe historical romance was also important at this time. But, while earlier writers of these romances paid little attention to historical reality, Walter Scott's historical novel Waverley (1814) broke with this tradition, and he invented \"the true historical novel\". At the same time he was influenced by gothic romance, and had collaborated in 1801 with 'Monk' Lewis on Tales of Wonder. With his Waverley novels Scott \"hoped to do for the Scottish border\" what Goethe and other German poets \"had done for the Middle Ages, \"and make its past live again in modern romance\". Scott's novels \"are in the mode he himself defined as romance, 'the interest of which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents'\". He used his imagination to re-evaluate history by rendering things, incidents and protagonists in the way only the novelist could do. His work remained historical fiction, yet it questioned existing historical perceptions. The use of historical research was an important tool: Scott, the novelist, resorted to documentary sources as any historian would have done, but as a romantic he gave his subject a deeper imaginative and emotional significance. By combining research with \"marvelous and uncommon incidents\", Scott attracted a far wider market than any historian could, and was the most famous novelist of his generation, throughout Europe.\n\nIn the 19th century the relationship between authors, publishers, and readers, changed. Authors originally had only received payment for their manuscript, however, changes in copyright laws, which began in 18th and continued into 19th century promised royalties on all future editions. Another change in the 19th century was that novelists began to read their works in theaters, halls, and bookshops. Also during the nineteenth century the market for popular fiction grew, and competed with works of literature. New institutions like the circulating library created a new market with a mass reading public.\n\nAnother difference was that novels began to deal with more difficult subjects, including current political and social issues, that were being discussed in newspapers and magazines. The idea of social responsibility became a key subject, whether of the citizen, or of the artist, with the theoretical debate concentrating on questions around the moral soundness of the modern novel. Questions about artistic integrity, as well as aesthetics, including, for example. the idea of \"art for art's sake\", proposed by writers like Oscar Wilde and Algernon Charles Swinburne, were also important.\n\nMajor British writers such as Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy were influenced by the romance genre tradition of the novel, which had been revitalized during the Romantic period. The Brontë sisters were notable mid-19th-century authors in this tradition, with Anne Brontë's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Publishing at the very end of the 19th century, Joseph Conrad has been called \"a supreme 'romancer.'\" In America \"the romance ... proved to be a serious, flexible, and successful medium for the exploration of philosophical ideas and attitudes.\" Notable examples include Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, and Herman Melville's Moby-Dick.\n\nA number of European novelists were similarly influenced influenced during this period by the earlier romance tradition, along with the Romanticism, including Victor Hugo, with novels like The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (1831) and Les Misérables (1862), and Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov with A Hero of Our Time (1840).\n\n\n\nMany 19th-century authors dealt with significant social matters. Émile Zola's novels depicted the world of the working classes, which Marx and Engels's non-fiction explores. In the United States slavery and racism became topics of far broader public debate thanks to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), which dramatizes topics that had previously been discussed mainly in the abstract. Charles Dickens' novels led his readers into contemporary workhouses, and provided first-hand accounts of child labor. The treatment of the subject of war changed with Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace (1868/69), where he questions the facts provided by historians. Similarly the treatment of crime is very different in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment (1866), where the point of view is that of a criminal. Women authors had dominated fiction from the 1640s into the early 18th century, but few before George Eliot so openly questioned the role, education, and status of women in society, as she did.\n\nAs the novel became a platform of modern debate, national literatures were developed that link the present with the past in the form of the historical novel. Alessandro Manzoni's I Promessi Sposi (1827) did this for Italy, while novelists in Russia and the surrounding Slavonic countries, as well as Scandinavia, did likewise.\n\nAlong with this new appreciation of history, the future also became a topic for fiction. This had been done earlier in works like Samuel Madden's Memoirs of the Twentieth Century (1733) and Mary Shelley's The Last Man (1826), a work whose plot culminated in the catastrophic last days of a mankind extinguished by the plague. Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward (1887) and H.G. Wells's The Time Machine (1895) were concerned with technological and biological developments. Industrialization, Darwin's theory of evolution and Marx's theory of class divisions shaped these works and turned historical processes into a subject of wide debate. Bellamy's Looking Backward became the second best-selling book of the 19th century after Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Such works led to the development of a whole genre of popular science fiction as the 20th century approached.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Joyce's Ulysses (1922) had a major influence on modern novelists, in the way that it replaced the 18th- and 19th-century narrator with a text that attempted to record inner thoughts, or a \"stream of consciousness\". This term was first used by William James in 1890 and, along with the related term interior monologue, is used by modernists like Dorothy Richardson, Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, and William Faulkner. Also in the 1920s expressionist Alfred Döblin went in a different direction with Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929), where interspersed non-fictional text fragments exist alongside the fictional material to create another new form of realism, which differs from that of stream-of-consciousness.\n\nLater works like Samuel Beckett's trilogy Molloy (1951), Malone Dies (1951) and The Unnamable (1953), as well as Julio Cortázar's Rayuela (1963) and Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow (1973) all make use of the stream-of-consciousness technique. On the other hand, Robert Coover is an example of those authors who, in the 1960s, fragmented their stories and challenged time and sequentiality as fundamental structural concepts. The 20th century novels deals with a wide range of subject matter. Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (1928) focusses on young German's experiences of World War I. The Jazz Age is explored by American F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the Great Depression by fellow American John Steinbeck. The rise of totalitarian states is the subject of British writer George Orwell. France's existentialism is the subject of French writers Jean-Paul Sartre's Nausea (1938) and Albert Camus' The Stranger (1942). The counterculture of the 1960s led to revived interest in Hermann Hesse's Steppenwolf (1927), and produced such iconic works of its own like Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. Novelist have also been interested in the subject of racial and gender identity in recent decades. Jesse Kavadlo of Maryville University of St. Louis has described Chuck Palahniuk's Fight Club (1996) as \"a closeted feminist critique\". Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, Doris Lessing, Elfriede Jelinek were feminist voices during this period.\n\nFurthermore, the major political and military confrontations of the 20th and 21st centuries have also influenced novelists. The events of World War II, from a German perspective, are dealt with by Günter Grass' The Tin Drum (1959) and an American by Joseph Heller's Catch-22 (1961). The subsequent Cold War influenced popular spy novels. Latin American self-awareness in the wake of the (failing) left revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s resulted in a \"Latin American Boom\", linked to with the names of novelists Julio Cortázar, Mario Vargas Llosa, Carlos Fuentes and Gabriel García Márquez, along with the invention of a special brand of postmodern magic realism.\n\nAnother major 20th-century social events, the so-called sexual revolution is reflected in the modern novel. D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover had to be published in Italy in 1928; British censorship lifted its ban as late as 1960. Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer (1934) created the comparable US scandal. Transgressive fiction from Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita (1955) to Michel Houellebecq's Les Particules élémentaires (1998) entered a literary field that eventually led to more pornographic works such as Anne Desclos' Story of O (1954) to Anaïs Nin's Delta of Venus (1978).\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Postmodern authors subverted serious debate with playfulness, claiming that art could never be original, that it always plays with existing materials. The idea that language is self-referential was already an accepted truth in the world of pulp fiction. A postmodernist re-reads popular literature as an essential cultural production. Novels from Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), to Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose (1980) and Foucault's Pendulum (1989) made use of intertextual references.\n\nSee also: Thriller, Westerns and Speculative fiction\n\nWhile the reader of so-called serious literature will follow public discussions of novels, popular fiction production employs more direct and short-term marketing strategies by openly declarating of the work's genre. Popular novels are based entirely on the expectations for the particular genre, and this includes the creation of a series of novels with an identifiable brand name. e.g. the Sherlock Holmes series by Arthur Conan Doyle\n\nPopular literature holds a larger market share. Romance fiction had an estimated $1.375 billion share in the US book market in 2007. Inspirational literature/religious literature followed with $819 million, science fiction/fantasy with $700 million, mystery with $650 million and then classic literary fiction with $466 million. Genre literature might be seen as the successor of the early modern chapbook. Both fields share a focus on readers who are in search of accessible reading satisfaction. The 20th-century love romance is a successor of the novels Madeleine de Scudéry, Marie de La Fayette, Aphra Behn, and Eliza Haywood wrote from the 1640s into the 1740s. The modern adventure novel goes back to Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719) and its immediate successors. Modern pornography has no precedent in the chapbook market but originates in libertine and hedonistic belles lettres, of works like John Cleland's Fanny Hill (1749) and similar eighteenth century novels. Ian Fleming's James Bond is a descendant of the anonymous yet extremely sophisticated and stylish narrator who mixed his love affairs with his political missions in La Guerre d'Espagne (1707). Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon is influenced by Tolkien, as well as Arthurian literature, including its 19th-century successors. Modern horror fiction also has no precedent on the market of chapbooks but goes back to the elitist market of early-19th-century Romantic literature. Modern popular science fiction has an even shorter history, from the 1860s.\n\nThe authors of popular fiction tend to advertise that they have exploited a controversial topic and this is a major difference between them and so-called elitist literature. Dan Brown, for example, discusses, on his website, the question whether his Da Vinci Code is an anti-Christian novel. And because authors of popular fiction have a fan community to serve, they can risk offending literary critic. However, the boundaries between popular and serious literature have blurred in recent years, with postmodernism and poststructuralism, as well as by adaptation of popular literary classics by the film and television industries. Crime became a major subject of 20th and 21st century genre novelists and crime fiction reflects the realities of modern industrialized societies. Crime is both a personal and public subject: criminals each have their personal motivations; detectives, see their moral codes challenged. Patricia Highsmith's thrillers became a medium of new psychological explorations. Paul Auster's New York Trilogy (1985–1986) is an example of experimental postmodernist literature based on this genre.\n\nFantasy is another major area of commercial fiction, and a major example is J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954/55), a work originally written for young readers that became a major cultural artefact. Tolkien in fact revived the tradition of European epic literature in the tradition of Beowulf, the North Germanic Edda and the Arthurian Cycles.\n\nScience fiction, is another important type of genre fiction and it has developed in a variety of ways, ranging from the early, technological adventure Jules Verne had made fashionable in the 1860s, to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) about Western consumerism and technology. George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) deals with totalitarianism and surveillance, among other matters, while Stanisław Lem, Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke produced modern classics which focus on the interaction between humans and machines. The surreal novels of Philip K Dick such as The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch explore the nature of reality, reflecting the widespread recreational experimentation with drugs and cold-war paranoia of the 60's and 70's. Writers such as Ursula le Guin and Margaret Atwood explore feminist and broader social issues in their works. William Gibson, author of the cult classic Neuromancer (1984), is one of a new wave of authors who explore post-apocalyptic fantasies and virtual reality.\n\n","I took my love, I took it down, climbed a mountain and I turned around, and I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills 'til the landslide brought it down.\nOh, mirror in the sky, what is love?\nCan the child within my heart rise above?\nCan I sail through the changin' ocean tides?\nCan I handle the seasons of my life?\n\nWell, I've been afraid of changin' 'cause I've built my life around you.\nBut time makes you bolder even children get older, and I'm getting older, too.\n\nI took my love, I took it down, I climbed a mountain and I turned around and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills, well the landslide will bring it down.\nAnd if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills, well the landslide will bring it down.\nOh, the landslide will bring it down.\n\n","Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans. I think I should start by saying, thanks for inviting me back. I come before you tonight with a challenge as great as any in our peacetime history and a plan of action to meet that challenge, to prepare our people for the bold new world of the 21st century.\nWe have much to be thankful for. With 4 years of growth, we have won back the basic strength of our economy.

We must be shapers of events, not observers. For if we do not act, the moment will pass, and we will lose the best possibilities of our future.\nWe face no imminent threat, but we do have an enemy. The enemy of our time is inaction. So tonight I issue a call to action: action by this Congress, action by our States, by our people, to prepare America for the 21st century; action to keep our economy and our democracy strong and working for all our people; action to strengthen education and harness the forces of technology and science; action to build stronger families and stronger communities and a safer environment; action to keep America the world's strongest force for peace, freedom, and prosperity; and above all, action to build a more perfect Union here at home.\nThe spirit we bring to our work will make all the difference. We must be committed to the pursuit of opportunity for all Americans, responsibility from all Americans, in a community of all Americans. And we must be committed to a new kind of Government, not to solve all our problems for us but to give our people, all our people, the tools they need to make the most of their own lives.\nAnd we must work together. The people of this Nation elected us all. They want us to be partners, not partisans. They put us all right here in the same boat, they gave us all oars, and they told us to row. Now, here is the direction I believe we should take.\nFirst, we must move quickly to complete the unfinished business of our country, to balance the budget, renew our democracy, and finish the job of welfare reform.\nOver the last 4 years, we have brought new economic growth by investing in our people, expanding our exports, cutting our deficits, creating over 11 million new jobs, a 4-year record. Now we must keep our economy the strongest in the world. We here tonight have an historic opportunity. Let this Congress be the Congress that finally balances the budget. Thank you.\nIn 2 days, I will propose a detailed plan to balance the budget by 2002. This plan will balance the budget and invest in our people while protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. It will balance the budget and build on the Vice President's efforts to make our Government work better, even as it costs less. It will balance the budget and provide middle class tax relief to pay for education and health care, to help to raise a child, to buy and sell a home.\nBalancing the budget requires only your vote and my signature. It does not require us to rewrite our Constitution. I believe it is both unnecessary and unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that could cripple our country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted results, such as judges halting Social Security checks or increasing taxes. Let us at least agree, we should not pass any measure—no measure should be passed that threatens Social Security. Whatever your view on that, we all must concede: We don't need a constitutional amendment; we need action.\nWhatever our differences, we should balance the budget now. And then, for the long-term health of our society, we must agree to a bipartisan process to preserve Social Security and reform Medicare for the long run, so that these fundamental programs will be as strong for our children as they are for our parents.\nAnd let me say something that's not in my script tonight. I know this is not going to be easy. But I really believe one of the reasons the American people gave me a second term was to take the tough decisions in the next 4 years that will carry our country through the next 50 years. I know it is easier for me than for you to say or do. But another reason I was elected is to support all of you, without regard to party, to give you what is necessary to join in these decisions. We owe it to our country and to our future.\nOur second piece of unfinished business requires us to commit ourselves tonight, before the eyes of America, to finally enacting bipartisan campaign finance reform. Now, Senators McCain and Feingold, Representatives Shays and Meehan, have reached across party lines here to craft tough and fair reform. Their proposal would curb spending, reduce the role of special interests, create a level playing field between challengers and incumbents, and ban contributions from noncitizens, all corporate sources, and the other large soft money contributions that both parties receive.\nYou know and I know that this can be delayed. And you know and I know the delay will mean the death of reform. So let's set our own deadline. Let's work together to write bipartisan campaign finance reform into law and pass McCain-Feingold by the day we celebrate the birth of our democracy, July the Fourth.\nThere is a third piece of unfinished business. Over the last 4 years, we moved a record 2ј million people off the welfare rolls. Then last year, Congress enacted landmark welfare reform legislation, demanding that all able-bodied recipients assume the responsibility of moving from welfare to work. Now each and every one of us has to fulfill our responsibility, indeed, our moral obligation, to make sure that people who now must work, can work.\nNow we must act to meet a new goal: 2 million more people off the welfare rolls by the year 2000. Here is my plan: Tax credits and other incentives for businesses that hire people off welfare; incentives for job placement firms and States to create more jobs for welfare recipients; training, transportation, and child care to help people go to work.\nNow I challenge every State: Turn those welfare checks into private sector paychecks. I challenge every religious congregation, every community nonprofit, every business to hire someone off welfare. And I'd like to say especially to every employer in our country who ever criticized the old welfare system, you can't blame that old system anymore. We have torn it down. Now do your part. Give someone on welfare the chance to go to work.\nTonight I am pleased to announce that five major corporations, Sprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King, and United Airlines, will be the first to join in a new national effort to marshal America's businesses, large and small, to create jobs so that people can move from welfare to work.\nWe passed welfare reform. All of you know I believe we were right to do it. But no one can walk out of this Chamber with a clear conscience unless you are prepared to finish the job.\nAnd we must join together to do something else, too, something both Republican and Democratic Governors have asked us to do, to restore basic health and disability benefits when misfortune strikes immigrants who came to this country legally, who work hard, pay taxes, and obey the law. To do otherwise is simply unworthy of a great nation of immigrants.\nNow, looking ahead, the greatest step of all, the high threshold of the future we must now cross, and my number one priority for the next 4 years is to ensure that all Americans have the best education in the world.\nLet's work together to meet these three goals: Every 8-year-old must be able to read; every 12-year-old must be able to log on to the Internet; every 18-year-old must be able to go to college; and every adult American must be able to keep on learning for a lifetime.\nMy balanced budget makes an unprecedented commitment to these goals, $51 billion next year. But far more than money is required. I have a plan, a call to action for American education, based on these 10 principles:\nFirst, a national crusade for education standards, not Federal Government standards but national standards, representing what all our students must know to succeed in the knowledge economy of the 21st century. Every State and school must shape the curriculum to reflect these standards and train teachers to lift students up to them. To help schools meet the standards and measure their progress, we will lead an effort over the next 2 years to develop national tests of student achievement in reading and math. Tonight I issue a challenge to the Nation: Every State should adopt high national standards, and by 1999, every State should test every fourth grader in reading and every eighth grader in math to make sure these standards are met.\nRaising standards will not be easy, and some of our children will not be able to meet them at first. The point is not to put our children down but to lift them up. Good tests will show us who needs help, what changes in teaching to make, and which schools need to improve. They can help us end social promotions, for no child should move from grade school to junior high or junior high to high school until he or she is ready.\nLast month, our Secretary of Education Dick Riley and I visited Northern Illinois, where eighth grade students from 20 school districts, in a project aptly called First in the World, took the Third International Math and Science Study. That's a test that reflects the world-class standards our children must meet for the new era. And those students in Illinois tied for first in the world in science and came in second in math. Two of them, Kristen Tanner and Chris Getsler, are here tonight, along with their teacher Sue Winski. They're up there with the First Lady. And they prove that when we aim high and challenge our students, they will be the best in the world. Let's give them a hand. Stand up, please.\nSecond, to have the best schools, we must have the best teachers. Most of us in this Chamber would not be here tonight without the help of those teachers. I know that I wouldn't be here. For years, many of our educators, led by North Carolina's Governor Jim Hunt and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, have worked very hard to establish nationally accepted credentials for excellence in teaching. Just 500 of these teachers have been certified since 1995. My budget will enable 100,000 more to seek national certification as master teachers. We should reward and recognize our best teachers. And as we reward them, we should quickly and fairly remove those few who don't measure up, and we should challenge more of our finest young people to consider teaching as a career.\nThird, we must do more to help all our children read. Forty percent—40 percent—of our 8-year-olds cannot read on their own. That's why we have just launched the America Reads initiative, to build a citizen army of one million volunteer tutors to make sure every child can read independently by the end of the third grade. We will use thousands of AmeriCorps volunteers to mobilize this citizen army. We want at least 100,000 college students to help. And tonight I am pleased that 60 college presidents have answered my call, pledging that thousands of their work-study students will serve for one year as reading tutors. This is also a challenge to every teacher and every principal. You must use these tutors to help students read. And it is especially a challenge to our parents. You must read with your children every night.\nThis leads to the fourth principle: Learning begins in the first days of life. Scientists are now discovering how young children develop emotionally and intellectually from their very first days and how important it is for parents to begin immediately talking, singing, even reading to their infants. The First Lady has spent years writing about this issue, studying it. And she and I are going to convene a White House conference on early learning and the brain this spring, to explore how parents and educators can best use these startling new findings.\nWe already know we should start teaching children before they start school. That's why this balanced budget expands Head Start to one million children by 2002. And that is why the Vice President and Mrs. Gore will host their annual family conference this June on what we can do to make sure that parents are an active part of their children's learning all the way through school.\nThey've done a great deal to highlight the importance of family in our life, and now they're turning their attention to getting more parents involved in their children's learning all the way through school. And I thank you, Mr. Vice President, and I thank you especially, Tipper, for what you do.\nFifth, every State should give parents the power to choose the right public school for their children. Their right to choose will foster competition and innovation that can make public schools better. We should also make it possible for more parents and teachers to start charter schools, schools that set and meet the highest standards and exist only as long as they do. Our plan will help America to create 3,000 of these charter schools by the next century, nearly 7 times as there are in the country today, so that parents will have even more choices in sending their children to the best schools.\nSixth, character education must be taught in our schools. We must teach our children to be good citizens. And we must continue to promote order and discipline, supporting communities that introduce school uniforms, impose curfews, enforce truancy laws, remove disruptive students from the classroom, and have zero tolerance for guns and drugs in school.\nSeventh, we cannot expect our children to raise themselves up in schools that are literally falling down. With the student population at an all-time high and record numbers of school buildings falling into disrepair, this has now become a serious national concern. Therefore, my budget includes a new initiative, $5 billion to help communities finance $20 billion in school construction over the next 4 years.\nEighth, we must make the 13th and 14th years of education, at least 2 years of college, just as universal in America by the 21st century as a high school education is today, and we must open the doors of college to all Americans. To do that, I propose America's HOPE scholarship, based on Georgia's pioneering program: 2 years of a $1,500 tax credit for college tuition, enough to pay for the typical community college. I also propose a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for all tuition after high school, an expanded IRA you can withdraw from tax free for education, and the largest increase in Pell grant scholarships in 20 years. Now, this plan will give most families the ability to pay no taxes on money they save for college tuition. I ask you to pass it and give every American who works hard the chance to go to college.\nNinth, in the 21st century, we must expand the frontiers of learning across a lifetime. All our people, of whatever age, must have the chance to learn new skills. Most Americans live near a community college. The roads that take them there can be paths to a better future. My \"GI bill\" for America's workers will transform the confusing tangle of Federal training programs into a simple skill grant to go directly into eligible workers' hands. For too long, this bill has been sitting on that desk there without action. I ask you to pass it now. Let's give more of our workers the ability to learn and to earn for a lifetime.\nTenth, we must bring the power of the information age into all our schools. Last year, I challenged America to connect every classroom and library to the Internet by the year 2000, so that, for the first time in our history, children in the most isolated rural towns, the most comfortable suburbs, the poorest inner-city schools, will have the same access to the same universe of knowledge.\nThat is my plan, a call to action for American education. Some may say that it is unusual for a President to pay this kind of attention to education. Some may say it is simply because the President and his wonderful wife have been obsessed with this subject for more years than they can recall. That is not what is driving these proposals.\nWe must understand the significance of this endeavor: One of the greatest sources of our strength throughout the cold war was a bipartisan foreign policy; because our future was at stake, politics stopped at the wa ter's edge. Now I ask you and I ask all our Nation's Governors; I ask parents, teachers, and citizens all across America for a new nonpartisan commitment to education because education is a critical national security issue for our future, and politics must stop at the schoolhouse door.\nTo prepare America for the 21st century, we must harness the powerful forces of science and technology to benefit all Americans. This is the first State of the Union carried live in video over the Internet. But we've only begun to spread the benefits of a technology revolution that should become the modern birthright of every citizen.\nOur effort to connect every classroom is just the beginning. Now we should connect every hospital to the Internet, so that doctors can instantly share data about their patients with the best specialists in the field. And I challenge the private sector tonight to start by connecting every children's hospital as soon as possible, so that a child in bed can stay in touch with school, family, and friends. A sick child need no longer be a child alone.\nWe must build the second generation of the Internet so that our leading universities and national laboratories can communicate in speeds 1,000 times faster than today, to develop new medical treatments, new sources of energy, new ways of working together.\nBut we cannot stop there. As the Internet becomes our new town square, a computer in every home, a teacher of all subjects, a connection to all cultures, this will no longer be a dream but a necessity. And over the next decade, that must be our goal.\nWe must continue to explore the heavens, pressing on with the Mars probes and the international space station, both of which will have practical applications for our everyday living.\nWe must speed the remarkable advances in medical science. The human genome project is now decoding the genetic mysteries of life. American scientists have discovered genes linked to breast cancer and ovarian cancer and medication that stops a stroke in progress and begins to reverse its effects and treatments that dramatically lengthen the lives of people with HIV and AIDS.\nSince I took office, funding for AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health has increased dramatically to $1.5 billion. With new resources, NIH will now become the most powerful discovery engine for an AIDS vaccine, working with other scientists to finally end the threat of AIDS. Remember that every year—every year we move up the discovery of an AIDS vaccine will save millions of lives around the world. We must reinforce our commitment to medical science.\nTo prepare America for the 21st century, we must build stronger families. Over the past 4 years, the family and medical leave law has helped millions of Americans to take time off to be with their families. With new pressures on people in the way they work and live, I believe we must expand family leave so that workers can take time off for teacher conferences and a child's medical checkup. We should pass flex-time, so workers can choose to be paid for overtime in income or trade it in for time off to be with their families.\nWe must continue, step by step, to give more families access to affordable, quality health care. Forty million Americans still lack health insurance. Ten million children still lack health insurance; 80 percent of them have working parents who pay taxes. That is wrong. My balanced budget will extend health coverage to up to 5 million of those children. Since nearly half of all children who lose their insurance do so because their parents lose or change a job, my budget will also ensure that people who temporarily lose their jobs can still afford to keep their health insurance. No child should be without a doctor just because a parent is without a job.\nMy Medicare plan modernizes Medicare, increases the life of the Trust Fund to 10 years, provides support for respite care for the many families with loved ones afflicted with Alzheimer's, and for the first time, it would fully pay for annual mammograms.\nJust as we ended drive-through deliveries of babies last year, we must now end the dangerous and demeaning practice of forcing women home from the hospital only hours after a mastectomy. I ask your support for bipartisan legislation to guarantee that a woman can stay in the hospital for 48 hours after a mastectomy. With us tonight is Dr.\nKristen Zarfos, a Connecticut surgeon whose outrage at this practice spurred a national movement and inspired this legislation. I'd like her to stand so we can thank her for her efforts. Dr. Zarfos, thank you.\nIn the last 4 years, we have increased child support collections by 50 percent. Now we should go further and do better by making it a felony for any parent to cross a State line in an attempt to flee from this, his or her most sacred obligation.\nFinally, we must also protect our children by standing firm in our determination to ban the advertising and marketing of cigarettes that endanger their lives.\nTo prepare America for the 21st century, we must build stronger communities. We should start with safe streets. Serious crime has dropped 5 years in a row. The key has been community policing. We must finish the job of putting 100,000 community police on the streets of the United States. We should pass the victims' rights amendment to the Constitution. And I ask you to mount a full-scale assault on juvenile crime, with legislation that declares war on gangs, with new prosecutors and tougher penalties; extends the Brady bill so violent teen criminals will not be able to buy handguns; requires child safety locks on handguns to prevent unauthorized use; and helps to keep our schools open after hours, on weekends, and in the summer, so our young people will have someplace to go and something to say yes to.\nThis balanced budget includes the largest antidrug effort ever, to stop drugs at their source, punish those who push them, and teach our young people that drugs are wrong, drugs are illegal, and drugs will kill them. I hope you will support it.\nOur growing economy has helped to revive poor urban and rural neighborhoods. But we must do more to empower them to create the conditions in which all families can flourish and to create jobs through investment by business and loans by banks. We should double the number of empowerment zones. They've already brought so much hope to communities like Detroit, where the unemployment rate has been cut in half in 4 years. We should restore contaminated urban land and buildings to productive use. We should expand the network of community development banks. And together we must pledge tonight that we will use this empowerment approach, including private-sector tax incentives, to renew our Capital City, so that Washington is a great place to work and live and once again the proud face America shows the world.\nWe must protect our environment in every community. In the last 4 years, we cleaned up 250 toxic waste sites, as many as in the previous 12. Now we should clean up 500 more, so that our children grow up next to parks, not poison. I urge you to pass my proposal to make big polluters live by a simple rule: If you pollute our environment, you should pay to clean it up.\nIn the last 4 years, we strengthened our Nation's safe food and clean drinking water laws; we protected some of America's rarest, most beautiful land in Utah's Red Rocks region, created three new national parks in the California desert, and began to restore the Florida Everglades. Now we must be as vigilant with our rivers as we are with our lands. Tonight, I announce that this year I will designate 10 American Heritage Rivers, to help communities alongside them revitalize their waterfronts and clean up pollution in the rivers, proving once again that we can grow the economy as we protect the environment.\nWe must also protect our global environment, working to ban the worst toxic chemicals and to reduce the greenhouse gases that challenge our health even as they change our climate.\nNow, we all know that in all of our communities, some of our children simply don't have what they need to grow and learn in their own homes or schools or neighborhoods. And that means the rest of us must do more, for they are our children, too. That's why President Bush, General Colin Powell, former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros will join the Vice President and me to lead the President's summit of service in Philadelphia in April.\nOur national service program, AmeriCorps, has already helped 70,000 young people to work their way through college as they serve America. Now we intend to mobilize millions of Americans to serve in thousands of ways. Citizen service is an American responsibility which all Americans should embrace, and I ask your support for that endeavor.\nI'd like to make just one last point about our national community. Our economy is measured in numbers and statistics, and it's very important. But the enduring worth of our Nation lies in our shared values and our soaring spirit. So instead of cutting back on our modest efforts to support the arts and humanities, I believe we should stand by them and challenge our artists, musicians, and writers, challenge our museums, libraries, and theaters. We should challenge all Americans in the arts and humanities to join with our fellow citizens to make the year 2000 a national celebration of the American spirit in every community, a celebration of our common culture in the century that has passed and in the new one to come in the new millennium, so that we can remain in the world's beacon not only of liberty but of creativity, long after the fireworks have faded.\nTo prepare America for the 21st century, we must master the forces of change in the world and keep American leadership strong and sure for an uncharted time.\nFifty years ago, a farsighted America led in creating the institutions that secured victory in the cold war and built a growing world economy. As a result, today more people than ever embrace our ideals and share our interests. Already we have dismantled many of the blocs and barriers that divided our parents' world. For the first time, more people live under democracy than dictatorship, including every nation in our own hemisphere but one, and its day, too, will come.\nNow, we stand at another moment of change and choice and another time to be farsighted, to bring America 50 more years of security and prosperity. In this endeavor, our first task is to help to build, for the very first time, an undivided, democratic Europe. When Europe is stable, prosperous, and at peace, America is more secure. To that end, we must expand NATO by 1999, so that countries that were once our adversaries can become our allies. At the special NATO summit this summer, that is what we will begin to do. We must strengthen NATO's Partnership For Peace with non-member allies. And we must build a stable partnership between NATO and a democratic Russia. An expanded NATO is good for America; and a Europe in which all democracies define their future not in terms of what they can do to each other but in terms of what they can do together for the good of all—that kind of Europe is good for America.\nSecond, America must look to the East no less than to the West. Our security demands it. Americans fought three wars in Asia in this century. Our prosperity requires it. More than 2 million American jobs depend upon trade with Asia.\nThere, too, we are helping to shape an Asia-Pacific community of cooperation, not conflict. Let our progress there not mask the peril that remains. Together with South Korea, we must advance peace talks with North Korea and bridge the cold war's last divide. And I call on Congress to fund our share of the agreement under which North Korea must continue to freeze and then dismantle its nuclear weapons program.\nWe must pursue a deeper dialog with China for the sake of our interests and our ideals. An isolated China is not good for America; a China playing its proper role in the world is. I will go to China, and I have invited China's President to come here, not because we agree on everything but because engaging China is the best way to work on our common challenges like ending nuclear testing and to deal frankly with our fundamental differences like human rights.\nThe American people must prosper in the global economy. We've worked hard to tear down trade barriers abroad so that we can create good jobs at home. I am proud to say that today America is once again the most competitive nation and the number one exporter in the world.\nNow we must act to expand our exports, especially to Asia and Latin America, two of the fastest growing regions on Earth, or be left behind as these emerging economies forge new ties with other nations. That is why we need the authority now to conclude new trade agreements that open markets to our goods and services even as we preserve our values.\nWe need not shrink from the challenge of the global economy. After all, we have the best workers and the best products. In a truly open market, we can out-compete anyone, anywhere on Earth.\nBut this is about more than economics. By expanding trade, we can advance the cause of freedom and democracy around the world. There is no better example of this truth than Latin America where democracy and open markets are on the march together. That is why I will visit there in the spring to reinforce our important tie.\nWe should all be proud that America led the effort to rescue our neighbor Mexico from its economic crises. And we should all be proud that last month Mexico repaid the United States, 3 full years ahead of schedule, with half a billion dollar profit to us.\nAmerica must continue to be an unrelenting force for peace from the Middle East to Haiti, from Northern Ireland to Africa. Taking reasonable risks for peace keeps us from being drawn into far more costly conflicts later.\nWith American leadership, the killing has stopped in Bosnia. Now the habits of peace must take hold. The new NATO force will allow reconstruction and reconciliation to accelerate. Tonight I ask Congress to continue its strong support of our troops. They are doing a remarkable job there for America, and America must do right by them.\nFifth, we must move strongly against new threats to our security. In the past 4 years, we agreed to ban—we led the way to a worldwide agreement to ban nuclear testing. With Russia, we dramatically cut nuclear arsenals, and we stopped targeting each others citizens. We are acting to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and to rid the world of landmines. We are working with other nations with renewed intensity to fight drug traffickers and to stop terrorists before they act and hold them fully accountable if they do.\nNow we must rise to a new test of leadership, ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention. Make no mistake about it, it will make our troops safer from chemical attack; it will help us to fight terrorism. We have no more important obligations, especially in the wake of what we now know about the Gulf war. This treaty has been bipartisan from the beginning, supported by Republican and Democratic administrations and Republican and Democratic Members of Congress and already approved by 68 nations.\nBut if we do not act by April 29th, when this convention goes into force with or without us, we will lose the chance to have Americans leading and enforcing this effort. Together we must make the Chemical Weapons Convention law, so that at last we can begin to outlaw poison gas from the Earth.\nFinally, we must have the tools to meet all these challenges. We must maintain a strong and ready military. We must increase funding for weapons modernization by the year 2000, and we must take good care of our men and women in uniform. They are the world's finest.\nWe must also renew our commitment to America's diplomacy and pay our debts and dues to international financial institutions like the World Bank and to a reforming United Nations. Every dollar we devote to preventing conflicts, to promoting democracy, to stopping the spread of disease and starvation, brings a sure return in security and savings. Yet international-affairs spending today is just one percent of the Federal budget, a small fraction of what America invested in diplomacy to choose leadership over escapism at the start of the cold war. If America is to continue to lead the world, we here who lead America simply must find the will to pay our way.\nA farsighted America moved the world to a better place over these last 50 years. And so it can be for another 50 years. But a shortsighted America will soon find its words falling on deaf ears all around the world.\nAlmost exactly 50 years ago, in the first winter of the cold war, President Truman stood before a Republican Congress and called upon our country to meet its responsibilities of leadership. This was his warning; he said, \"If we falter, we may endanger the peace of the world, and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this Nation.\" That Congress, led by Republicans like Senator Arthur Vandenberg, answered President Truman's call. Together, they made the commitments that strengthened our country for 50 years. Now let us do the same. Let us do what it takes to remain the indispensable nation, to keep America strong, secure, and prosperous for another 50 years.\nIn the end, more than anything else, our world leadership grows out of the power of our example here at home, out of our ability to remain strong as one America.\nAll over the world, people are being torn asunder by racial, ethnic, and religious conflicts that fuel fanaticism and terror. We are the world's most diverse democracy, and the world looks to us to show that it is possible to live and advance together across those kinds of differences.\nAmerica has always been a nation of immigrants. From the start, a steady stream of people in search of freedom and opportunity have left their own lands to make this land their home. We started as an experiment in democracy fueled by Europeans. We have grown into an experiment in democratic diversity fueled by openness and promise.\nMy fellow Americans, we must never, ever believe that our diversity is a weakness. It is our greatest strength. Americans speak every language, know every country. People on every continent can look to us and see the reflection of their own great potential, and they always will, as long as we strive to give all of our citizens, whatever their background, an opportunity to achieve their own greatness.\nWe're not there yet. We still see evidence of abiding bigotry and intolerance in ugly words and awful violence, in burned churches and bombed buildings. We must fight against this, in our country and in our hearts.\nJust a few days before my second Inauguration, one of our country's best known pastors, Reverend Robert Schuller, suggested that I read Isaiah 58:12. Here's what it says: \"Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in.\" I placed my hand on that verse when I took the oath of office, on behalf of all Americans, for no matter what our differences in our faiths, our backgrounds, our politics, we must all be repairers of the breach.\nI want to say a word about two other Americans who show us how. Congressman Frank Tejeda was buried yesterday, a proud American whose family came from Mexico. He was only 51 years old. He was awarded the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart fighting for his country in Vietnam. And he went on to serve Texas and America fighting for our future here in this Chamber. We are grateful for his service and honored that his mother, Lillie Tejeda, and his sister, Mary Alice, have come from Texas to be with us here tonight. And we welcome you.\nGary Locke, the newly elected Governor of Washington State, is the first Chinese-American Governor in the history of our country. He's the proud son of two of the millions of Asian-American immigrants who have strengthened America with their hard work, family values, and good citizenship. He represents the future we can all achieve. Thank you, Governor, for being here. Please stand up.\nReverend Schuller, Congressman Tejeda, Governor Locke, along with Kristen Tanner and Chris Getsler, Sue Winski and Dr. Kristen Zarfos, they're all Americans from different roots whose lives reflect the best of what we can become when we are one America. We may not share a common past, but we surely do share a common future. Building one America is our most important mission, the foundation for many generations of every other strength we must build for this new century. Money cannot buy it. Power cannot compel it. Technology cannot create it. It can only come from the human spirit.\nAmerica is far more than a place. It is an idea, the most powerful idea in the history of nations. And all of us in this Chamber, we are now the bearers of that idea, leading a great people into a new world. A child born tonight will have almost no memory of the 20th century. Everything that child will know about America will be because of what we do now to build a new century.\nWe don't have a moment to waste. Tomorrow there will be just over 1,000 days until the year 2000; 1,000 days to prepare our people; 1,000 days to work together; 1,000 days to build a bridge to a land of new promise. My fellow Americans, we have work to do. Let us seize those days and the century.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.\n","HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy\nPrince.  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes\nhe had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his\nsword-hilt.\n\nHe was very much admired indeed.  “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,”\nremarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for\nhaving artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing\nlest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\n\n“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible mother of her\nlittle boy who was crying for the moon.  “The Happy Prince never dreams\nof crying for anything.”\n\n“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a\ndisappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\n\n“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out\nof the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white\npinafores.\n\n“How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen\none.”\n\n“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the\nMathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not\napprove of children dreaming.\n\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had\ngone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was\nin love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring\nas he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so\nattracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\n\n“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at\nonce, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her,\ntouching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was\nhis courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\n“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has\nno money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite\nfull of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.\n\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.\n“She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a\ncoquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.”  And certainly,\nwhenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  “I\nadmit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my\nwife, consequently, should love travelling also.”\n\n“Will you come away with me?” he said finally to her; but the Reed shook\nher head, she was so attached to her home.\n\n“You have been trifling with me,” he cried.  “I am off to the Pyramids.\nGood-bye!” and he flew away.\n\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  “Where\nshall I put up?” he said; “I hope the town has made preparations.”\n\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\n\n“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of\nfresh air.”  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\n\n“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round,\nand he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under\nhis wing a large drop of water fell on him.  “What a curious thing!” he\ncried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear\nand bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is\nreally dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her\nselfishness.”\n\nThen another drop fell.\n\n“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he said; “I\nmust look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.\n\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up,\nand saw—Ah! what did he see?\n\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were\nrunning down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the\nmoonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\n\n“Who are you?” he said.\n\n“I am the Happy Prince.”\n\n“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched\nme.”\n\n“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not\nknow what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where\nsorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my\ncompanions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great\nHall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask\nwhat lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers\ncalled me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be\nhappiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have\nset me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery\nof my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but\nweep.”\n\n“What! is he not solid gold?” said the Swallow to himself.  He was too\npolite to make any personal remarks out loud.\n\n“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a\nlittle street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and\nthrough it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and\nworn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she\nis a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for\nthe loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next\nCourt-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying\nill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing\nto give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little\nSwallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet\nare fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow.  “My friends are flying up\nand down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they\nwill go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there\nhimself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and\nembalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and\nhis hands are like withered leaves.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and\nthe mother so sad.”\n\n“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow.  “Last summer, when I\nwas staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons,\nwho were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we\nswallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family\nfamous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.”\n\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.\n“It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one night,\nand be your messenger.”\n\n“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.\n\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and\nflew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\n\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were\nsculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A\nbeautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  “How wonderful\nthe stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the power of love!”\n\n“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she answered;\n“I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the\nseamstresses are so lazy.”\n\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of\nthe ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining\nwith each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he\ncame to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on\nhis bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he\nhopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble.\nThen he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his\nwings.  “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and\nhe sank into a delicious slumber.\n\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had\ndone.  “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although\nit is so cold.”\n\n“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince.  And the\nlittle Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always\nmade him sleepy.\n\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  “What a\nremarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was\npassing over the bridge.  “A swallow in winter!”  And he wrote a long\nletter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full\nof so many words that they could not understand.\n\n“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at\nthe prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time\non top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped,\nand said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so he enjoyed\nhimself very much.\n\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  “Have you any\ncommissions for Egypt?” he cried; “I am just starting.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow.  “To-morrow my friends\nwill fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among\nthe bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All\nnight long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he\nutters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions\ncome down to the water’s edge to drink.  They have eyes like green\nberyls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the\ncity I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered\nwith papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered\nviolets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a\npomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a\nplay for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any\nmore.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.”\n\n“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really had\na good heart.  “Shall I take him another ruby?”\n\n“Alas!  I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I\nhave left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of\nIndia a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.\nHe will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish\nhis play.”\n\n“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to\nweep.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the\nstudent’s garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in\nthe roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man\nhad his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the\nbird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying\non the withered violets.\n\n“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some great\nadmirer.  Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.\n\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of\na large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold\nwith ropes.  “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up.  “I am\ngoing to Egypt”! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon\nrose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n\n“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be\nhere.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the\ncrocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are\nbuilding a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves\nare watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave\nyou, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back\ntwo beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby\nshall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the\ngreat sea.”\n\n“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little\nmatch-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all\nspoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money,\nand she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is\nbare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will\nnot beat her.”\n\n“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot\npluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it.  He\nswooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her\nhand.  “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran\nhome, laughing.\n\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince.  “You are blind now,” he said,\n“so I will stay with you always.”\n\n“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt.”\n\n“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the\nPrince’s feet.\n\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of\nwhat he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who\nstand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their\nbeaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the\ndesert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the\nside of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King\nof the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a\nlarge crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and\nhas twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who\nsail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the\nbutterflies.\n\n“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous\nthings, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of\nwomen.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little\nSwallow, and tell me what you see there.”\n\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in\ntheir beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He\nflew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children\nlooking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a\nbridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep\nthemselves warm.  “How hungry we are!” they said.  “You must not lie\nhere,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\n\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\n\n“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off,\nleaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold\ncan make them happy.”\n\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy\nPrince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he\nbrought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier, and they\nlaughed and played games in the street.  “We have bread now!” they cried.\n\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets\nlooked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and\nglistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of\nthe houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore\nscarlet caps and skated on the ice.\n\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave\nthe Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the\nbaker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself\nwarm by flapping his wings.\n\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to\nfly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more.  “Good-bye, dear Prince!” he\nmurmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?”\n\n“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the\nPrince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips,\nfor I love you.”\n\n“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow.  “I am going to\nthe House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?”\n\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his\nfeet.\n\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something\nhad broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.\nIt certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\n\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in\ncompany with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked\nup at the statue: “Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!” he said.\n\n“How shabby indeed!” cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with\nthe Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\n\n“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is\ngolden no longer,” said the Mayor in fact, “he is litttle better than a\nbeggar!”\n\n“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors.\n\n“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!” continued the Mayor.  “We\nmust really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die\nhere.”  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\n\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  “As he is no longer\nbeautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the\nUniversity.\n\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of\nthe Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  “We must\nhave another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a statue of\nmyself.”\n\n“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.\nWhen I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.\n\n“What a strange thing!” said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.\n“This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it\naway.”  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also\nlying.\n\n“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to one of\nHis Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\n\n“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of Paradise this\nlittle bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy\nPrince shall praise me.”\n\n","Madame Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, and the First Lady of the United States:\nI've come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great chamber, but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here.\nI know that for many Americans watching right now, the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others. And rightly so. If you haven't been personally affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has - a friend; a neighbor; a member of your family. You don't need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis, because you live it every day. It's the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights. It's the job you thought you'd retire from but now have lost; the business you built your dreams upon that's now hanging by a thread; the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope. The impact of this recession is real, and it is everywhere.\nBut while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken; though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want every American to know this:\nWe will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before.\nThe weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation. The answers to our problems don't lie beyond our reach. They exist in our laboratories and universities; in our fields and our factories; in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest-working people on Earth. Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure. What is required now is for this country to pull together, confront boldly the challenges we face, and take responsibility for our future once more.\nNow, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that for too long, we have not always met these responsibilities — as a government or as a people. I say this not to lay blame or look backwards, but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we'll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament.\nThe fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight. Nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank. We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy. Yet we import more oil today than ever before. The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year, yet we keep delaying reform. Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for. And though all these challenges went unsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as individuals and through our government, than ever before.\nIn other words, we have lived through an era where too often, short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity; where we failed to look beyond the next payment, the next quarter, or the next election. A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future. Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day.\nWell that day of reckoning has arrived, and the time to take charge of our future is here.\nNow is the time to act boldly and wisely — to not only revive this economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity. Now is the time to jumpstart job creation, re-start lending, and invest in areas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our economy, even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down. That is what my economic agenda is designed to do, and that's what I'd like to talk to you about tonight.\nIt's an agenda that begins with jobs.\nAs soon as I took office, I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President's Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets. Not because I believe in bigger government — I don't. Not because I'm not mindful of the massive debt we've inherited — I am. I called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardships. In fact, a failure to act would have worsened our long-term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years. That's why I pushed for quick action. And tonight, I am grateful that this Congress delivered, and pleased to say that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is now law.\nOver the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs.More than 90% of these jobs will be in the private sector — jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges; constructing wind turbines and solar panels; laying broadband and expanding mass transit.\nBecause of this plan, there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids. Health care professionals can continue caring for our sick. There are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of Minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make.\nBecause of this plan, 95% of the working households in America will receive a tax cut — a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on April 1st.\nBecause of this plan, families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a $2,500 tax credit for all four years of college. And Americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm.\nI know there are some in this chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work. I understand that skepticism. Here in Washington, we've all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending. And with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right.\nThat is why I have asked Vice President Biden to lead a tough, unprecedented oversight effort — because nobody messes with Joe. I have told each member of my Cabinet as well as mayors and governors across the country that they will be held accountable by me and the American people for every dollar they spend. I have appointed a proven and aggressive Inspector General to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud. And we have created a new website called recovery.gov so that every American can find out how and where their money is being spent.\nSo the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track. But it is just the first step. Because even if we manage this plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system.\nI want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight, because every American should know that it directly affects you and your family's well-being. You should also know that the money you've deposited in banks across the country is safe; your insurance is secure; and you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system. That is not the source of concern.\nThe concern is that if we do not re-start lending in this country, our recovery will be choked off before it even begins.\nYou see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy. The ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education; how stores stock their shelves, farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll.\nBut credit has stopped flowing the way it should. Too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks. With so much debt and so little confidence, these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households, to businesses, or to each other. When there is no lending, families can't afford to buy homes or cars. So businesses are forced to make layoffs. Our economy suffers even more, and credit dries up even further.\nThat is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle, restore confidence, and re-start lending.\nWe will do so in several ways. First, we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans, and small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running.\nSecond, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and re-finance their mortgages. It's a plan that won't help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values - Americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped bring about. In fact, the average family who re-finances today can save nearly $2000 per year on their mortgage.\n\nThird, we will act with the full force of the federal government to ensure that the major banks that Americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times. And when we learn that a major bank has serious problems, we will hold accountable those responsible, force the necessary adjustments, provide the support to clean up their balance sheets, and assure the continuity of a strong, viable institution that can serve our people and our economy.\nI understand that on any given day, Wall Street may be more comforted by an approach that gives banks bailouts with no strings attached, and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions. But such an approach won't solve the problem. And our goal is to quicken the day when we re-start lending to the American people and American business and end this crisis once and for all.\nI intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive, and this time, they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer. This time, CEOs won't be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet. Those days are over.\nStill, this plan will require significant resources from the federal government — and yes, probably more than we've already set aside. But while the cost of action will be great, I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater, for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years, but perhaps a decade. That would be worse for our deficit, worse for business, worse for you, and worse for the next generation. And I refuse to let that happen.\nI understand that when the last administration asked this Congress to provide assistance for struggling banks, Democrats and Republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and results that followed. So were the American taxpayers. So was I.\nSo I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now, especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions. I promise you - I get it.\nBut I also know that in a time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern out of anger, or yield to the politics of the moment. My job — our job — is to solve the problem. Our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility. I will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single Wall Street executive, but I will do whatever it takes to help the small business that can't pay its workers or the family that has saved and still can't get a mortgage.\nThat's what this is about. It's not about helping banks — it's about helping people. Because when credit is available again, that young family can finally buy a new home. And then some company will hire workers to build it. And then those workers will have money to spend, and if they can get a loan too, maybe they'll finally buy that car, or open their own business. Investors will return to the market, and American families will see their retirement secured once more. Slowly, but surely, confidence will return, and our economy will recover.\nSo I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary. Because we cannot consign our nation to an open-ended recession. And to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again, I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system. It is time to put in place tough, new common-sense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation, and punishes short-cuts and abuse.\nThe recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we're taking to revive our economy in the short-term. But the only way to fully restore America's economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world. The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care; the schools that aren't preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit. That is our responsibility.\nIn the next few days, I will submit a budget to Congress. So often, we have come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or laundry lists of programs. I see this document differently. I see it as a vision for America — as a blueprint for our future.\nMy budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue. It reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited — a trillion dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession.\nGiven these realities, everyone in this chamber - Democrats and Republicans — will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars. And that includes me.\nBut that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long-term challenges. I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves; that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity.\nFor history tells a different story. History reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation, this nation has responded with bold action and big ideas. In the midst of civil war, we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry. From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age. In the wake of war and depression, the GI Bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle-class in history. And a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways, an American on the moon, and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world.\nIn each case, government didn't supplant private enterprise; it catalyzed private enterprise. It created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive.\nWe are a nation that has seen promise amid peril, and claimed opportunity from ordeal. Now we must be that nation again. That is why, even as it cuts back on the programs we don't need, the budget I submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future: energy, health care, and education.\nIt begins with energy.\nWe know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century. And yet, it is China that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient. We invented solar technology, but we've fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in producing it. New plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will run on batteries made in Korea.\nWell I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders - and I know you don't either. It is time for America to lead again.\nThanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation's supply of renewable energy in the next three years. We have also made the largest investment in basic research funding in American history - an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy, but breakthroughs in medicine, science, and technology.\nWe will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country. And we will put Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills.\nBut to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in America. And to support that innovation, we will invest fifteen billion dollars a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power; advanced biofuels, clean coal, and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks built right here in America.\n\nAs for our auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad decision-making and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink. We should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad practices. But we are committed to the goal of a re-tooled, re-imagined auto industry that can compete and win. Millions of jobs depend on it. Scores of communities depend on it. And I believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it.\nNone of this will come without cost, nor will it be easy. But this is America. We don't do what's easy. We do what is necessary to move this country forward.\nFor that same reason, we must also address the crushing cost of health care.\nThis is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every thirty seconds. By the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million Americans to lose their homes. In the last eight years, premiums have grown four times faster than wages. And in each of these years, one million more Americans have lost their health insurance. It is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas. And it's one of the largest and fastest-growing parts of our budget.\nGiven these facts, we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold.\nAlready, we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last thirty days than we have in the last decade. When it was days old, this Congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for eleven million American children whose parents work full-time. Our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records and new technology that will reduce errors, bring down costs, ensure privacy, and save lives. It will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every American by seeking a cure for cancer in our time. And it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that is one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control.\nThis budget builds on these reforms. It includes an historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform — a down-payment on the principle that we must have quality, affordable health care for every American. It's a commitment that's paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue. And it's a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come.\nNow, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform, and that is why I'm bringing together businesses and workers, doctors and health care providers, Democrats and Republicans to begin work on this issue next week.\nI suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process. It will be hard. But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and the conscience of our nation long enough. So let there be no doubt: health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year.\nThe third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in America.\nIn a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity — it is a pre-requisite.\nRight now, three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations require more than a high school diploma. And yet, just over half of our citizens have that level of education. We have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation. And half of the students who begin college never finish.\nThis is a prescription for economic decline, because we know the countries that out-teach us today will out-compete us tomorrow. That is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education — from the day they are born to the day they begin a career.\nAlready, we have made an historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan. We have dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality, because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life. We have made college affordable for nearly seven million more students. And we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children's progress.\nBut we know that our schools don't just need more resources. They need more reform. That is why this budget creates new incentives for teacher performance; pathways for advancement, and rewards for success. We'll invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps. And we will expand our commitment to charter schools.\nIt is our responsibility as lawmakers and educators to make this system work. But it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it. And so tonight, I ask every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training. This can be community college or a four-year school; vocational training or an apprenticeship. But whatever the training may be, every American will need to get more than a high school diploma. And dropping out of high school is no longer an option. It's not just quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country — and this country needs and values the talents of every American. That is why we will provide the support necessary for you to complete college and meet a new goal: by 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.\nI know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country, we will make sure that you can afford a higher education. And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations, I ask this Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country — Senator Edward Kennedy.\nThese education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children. But it is up to us to ensure they walk through them. In the end, there is no program or policy that can substitute for a mother or father who will attend those parent/teacher conferences, or help with homework after dinner, or turn off the TV, put away the video games, and read to their child. I speak to you not just as a President, but as a father when I say that responsibility for our children's education must begin at home.\nThere is, of course, another responsibility we have to our children. And that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay. With the deficit we inherited, the cost of the crisis we face, and the long-term challenges we must meet, it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this deficit down.\nI'm proud that we passed the recovery plan free of earmarks, and I want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities.\nYesterday, I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office. My administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs. As you can imagine, this is a process that will take some time. But we're starting with the biggest lines. We have already identified two trillion dollars in savings over the next decade.\n\nIn this budget, we will end education programs that don't work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don't need them. We'll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we're not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we don't use. We will root out the waste, fraud, and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn't make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas.\nIn order to save our children from a future of debt, we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2% of Americans. But let me perfectly clear, because I know you'll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people: if your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: not one single dime. In fact, the recovery plan provides a tax cut — that's right, a tax cut — for 95% of working families. And these checks are on the way.\nTo preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the growing costs in Medicare and Social Security. Comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come. And we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all Americans.\nFinally, because we're also suffering from a deficit of trust, I am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget. That is why this budget looks ahead ten years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules - and for the first time, that includes the full cost of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. For seven years, we have been a nation at war. No longer will we hide its price.\nWe are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and I will soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war.\nAnd with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat al Qaeda and combat extremism. Because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens half a world away.\nAs we meet here tonight, our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy. To each and every one of them, and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence, Americans are united in sending one message: we honor your service, we are inspired by your sacrifice, and you have our unyielding support. To relieve the strain on our forces, my budget increases the number of our soldiers and Marines. And to keep our sacred trust with those who serve, we will raise their pay, and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned.\nTo overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend — because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of America. That is why I have ordered the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists - because living our values doesn't make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger. And that is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture.\nIn words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun. For we know that America cannot meet the threats of this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without America. We cannot shun the negotiating table, nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm. We are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand.\nTo seek progress toward a secure and lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors, we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort. To meet the challenges of the 21st century - from terrorism to nuclear proliferation; from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty — we will strengthen old alliances, forge new ones, and use all elements of our national power.\nAnd to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope, we are working with the nations of the G-20 to restore confidence in our financial system, avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism, and spur demand for American goods in markets across the globe. For the world depends on us to have a strong economy, just as our economy depends on the strength of the world's.\nAs we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us - watching to see what we do with this moment; waiting for us to lead.\nThose of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times. It is a tremendous burden, but also a great privilege - one that has been entrusted to few generations of Americans. For in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill.\nI know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth — to become cynical and doubtful; consumed with the petty and the trivial.\nBut in my life, I have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places; that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity, but from the dreams and aspirations of Americans who are anything but ordinary.\nI think about Leonard Abess, the bank president from Miami who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus, and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him, plus another 72 who used to work for him. He didn't tell anyone, but when the local newspaper found out, he simply said, I knew some of these people since I was 7 years old. I didn't feel right getting the money myself.\"\nI think about Greensburg, Kansas, a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado, but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community - how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay. \"The tragedy was terrible,\" said one of the men who helped them rebuild. \"But the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity.\"\nAnd I think about Ty'Sheoma Bethea, the young girl from that school I visited in Dillon, South Carolina — a place where the ceilings leak, the paint peels off the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom. She has been told that her school is hopeless, but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this room. She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp. The letter asks us for help, and says, \"We are just students trying to become lawyers, doctors, congressmen like yourself and one day president, so we can make a change to not just the state of South Carolina but also the world. We are not quitters.\"\nWe are not quitters.\nThese words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here. They tell us that even in the most trying times, amid the most difficult circumstances, there is a generosity, a resilience, a decency, and a determination that perseveres; a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity.\nTheir resolve must be our inspiration. Their concerns must be our cause. And we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us.\nI know that we haven't agreed on every issue thus far, and there are surely times in the future when we will part ways. But I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed. That must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months, and where we return after those debates are done. That is the foundation on which the American people expect us to build common ground.\nAnd if we do — if we come together and lift this nation from the depths of this crisis; if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity; if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an America that does not quit, then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed, in the words that are carved into this very chamber, \"something worthy to be remembered.\"\nThank you, God Bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America.\n","He's a real nowhere man\nSitting in his nowhere land\nMaking all his nowhere plans for nobody\n\nDoesn't have a point of view\nKnows not where he's going to\nIsn't he a bit like you and me?\nNowhere man please listen\nYou don't know what you're missing\nNowhere man, The world is at your command\n\nHe's as blind as he can be\nJust sees what he wants to see\nNowhere man, can you see me at all\nNowhere man don't worry\nTake your time, don't hurry\nLeave it all till somebody else\nLends you a hand\n\nDoesn't have a point of view\nKnows not where he's going to\nIsn't he a bit like you and me?\nNowhere man please listen\nYou don't know what you're missing\nNowhere man, The world is at your command\n\n","I once had a girl\nOr should I say she once had me\nShe showed me her room\nIsn't it good Norwegian wood?\n\nShe asked me to stay\nAnd she told me to sit anywhere\nSo I looked around\nAnd I noticed there wasn't a chair\n\nI sat on the rug biding my time, drinking her wine\nWe talked until two and then she said it's time for bed\n\nShe told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.\nI told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath\n\nAnd when I awoke I was alone\nThis bird had flown\nSo I lit a fire\nIsn't it good Norwegian wood?\n\n","Rock on, gold dust woman.\nTake your silver spoon.\nDig your grave.\n\nHeartless challenge, pick your path and I'll pray.\n\nWake up in the morning, see your sunrise loves to go down.\nLousy lovers pick their prey, but they never cry out loud.\n\nDid she make you cry?\nMake you break down?\nShatter your illusions of love?\nAnd is it over now?\nDo you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?\n\nRock on ancient queen, follow those who pale in your shadow.\n\nRulers make bad lovers.\nYou better put your kingdom up for sale.\n\n","\nA disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of part or all of an organism, and that is not due to any external injury. Diseases are often construed as medical conditions that are associated with specific symptoms and signs. A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions. For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies and autoimmune disorders.\n\nIn humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person. In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life.\n\nDeath due to disease is called death by natural causes. There are four main types of disease: infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases), and physiological diseases. Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable versus non-communicable diseases. The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections. In developed countries, the diseases that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety.\n\nThe study of disease is called pathology, which includes the study of etiology, or cause.\n\n\n\nIn many cases, terms such as disease, disorder, morbidity, sickness and illness are used interchangeably. There are situations, however, when specific terms are considered preferable.\n\n\n * Disease\n * The term disease broadly refers to any condition that impairs the normal functioning of the body. For this reason, diseases are associated with dysfunctioning of the body's normal homeostatic processes. Commonly, the term is used to refer specifically to infectious diseases, which are clinically evident diseases that result from the presence of pathogenic microbial agents, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, multicellular organisms, and aberrant proteins known as prions.  An infection or colonization that does not and will not produce clinically evident impairment of normal functioning, such as the presence of the normal bacteria and yeasts in the gut, or of a passenger virus, is not considered a disease. By contrast, an infection that is asymptomatic during its incubation period, but expected to produce symptoms later, is usually considered a disease.  Non-infectious diseases are all other diseases, including most forms of cancer, heart disease, and genetic disease.\n * Acquired disease\n * An acquired disease is one that began at some point during one's lifetime, as opposed to disease that was already present at birth, which is congenital disease. Acquired sounds like it could mean \"caught via contagion\", but it simply means acquired sometime after birth. It also sounds like it could imply secondary disease, but acquired disease can be primary disease.\n * Acute disease\n * An acute disease is one of a short-term nature (acute); the term sometimes also connotes a fulminant nature\n * Chronic condition or chronic disease\n * A chronic disease is one that persists over time, often characterized as at least six months but may also include illnesses that are expected to last for the entirety of one's natural life.\n * Congenital disorder or congenital disease\n * A congenital disorder is one that is present at birth. It is often a genetic disease or disorder and can be inherited. It can also be the result of a vertically transmitted infection from the mother, such as HIV/AIDS.\n * Genetic disease\n * A genetic disorder or disease is caused by one or more genetic mutations. It is often inherited, but some mutations are random and de novo.\n * Hereditary or inherited disease\n * A hereditary disease is a type of genetic disease caused by genetic mutations that are hereditary (and can run in families)\n * Iatrogenic disease\n * An iatrogenic disease or condition is one that is caused by medical intervention, whether as a side effect of a treatment or as an inadvertent outcome.\n * Idiopathic disease\n * An idiopathic disease has an unknown cause or source. As medical science has advanced, many diseases with entirely unknown causes have had some aspects of their sources explained and therefore shed their idiopathic status. For example, when germs were discovered, it became known that they were a cause of infection, but particular germs and diseases had not been linked. In another example, it is known that autoimmunity is the cause of some forms of diabetes mellitus type 1, even though the particular molecular pathways by which it works are not yet understood. It is also common to know certain factors are associated with certain diseases. However, association and causality are two very different phenomena, as a third cause might be producing the disease, as well as an associated phenomenon.\n * Incurable disease\n * A disease that cannot be cured. Incurable diseases are not necessarily terminal diseases, and sometimes a disease's symptoms can be treated sufficiently for the disease to have little or no impact on quality of life.\n * Primary disease\n * A primary disease is a disease that is due to a root cause of illness, as opposed to secondary disease, which is a sequela, or complication that is caused by the primary disease. For example, a common cold is a primary disease, where rhinitis is a possible secondary disease, or sequela. A doctor must determine what primary disease, a cold or a bacterial infection, is causing a patient's secondary rhinitis when deciding whether or not to prescribe antibiotics.\n * Secondary disease\n * A secondary disease is a disease that is a sequela or complication of a prior, causal disease, which is referred to as the primary disease or simply the underlying cause (root cause). For example, a bacterial infection can be primary, wherein a healthy person is exposed to a bacteria and becomes infected, or it can be secondary to a primary cause, that predisposes the body to infection. For example, a primary viral infection that weakens the immune system could lead to a secondary bacterial infection. Similarly, a primary burn that creates an open wound could provide an entry point for bacteria, and lead to a secondary bacterial infection.\n * Terminal disease\n * A terminal disease is one that is expected to have the inevitable result of death. Previously, AIDS was a terminal disease; it is now incurable, but can be managed indefinitely using medications.\n * Illness\n * The terms illness and sickness are both generally used as synonyms for disease. However, the term illness is occasionally used to refer specifically to the patient's personal experience of his or her disease.   In this model, it is possible for a person to have a disease without being ill (to have an objectively definable, but asymptomatic, medical condition, such as a subclinical infection, or to have a clinically apparent physical impairment but not feel sick or distressed by it), and to be ill without being diseased (such as when a person perceives a normal experience as a medical condition, or medicalizes a non-disease situation in his or her life—for example, a person who feels unwell as a result of embarrassment, and who interprets those feelings as sickness rather than normal emotions). Symptoms of illness are often not directly the result of infection, but a collection of evolved responses—sickness behavior by the body—that helps clear infection and promote recovery. Such aspects of illness can include lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, sleepiness, hyperalgesia, and inability to concentrate.\n * A disorder is a functional abnormality or disturbance. Medical disorders can be categorized into mental disorders, physical disorders, genetic disorders, emotional and behavioral disorders, and functional disorders. The term disorder is often considered more value-neutral and less stigmatizing than the terms disease or illness, and therefore is a preferred terminology in some circumstances. In mental health, the term mental disorder is used as a way of acknowledging the complex interaction of biological, social, and psychological factors in psychiatric conditions.  However, the term disorder is also used in many other areas of medicine, primarily to identify physical disorders that are not caused by infectious organisms, such as metabolic disorders.\n * Medical condition\n * A medical condition is a broad term that includes all diseases, lesions, disorders, or nonpathologic condition that normally receives medical treatment, such as pregnancy or childbirth. While the term medical condition generally includes mental illnesses, in some contexts the term is used specifically to denote any illness, injury, or disease except for mental illnesses. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the widely used psychiatric manual that defines all mental disorders, uses the term general medical condition to refer to all diseases, illnesses, and injuries except for mental disorders. This usage is also commonly seen in the psychiatric literature. Some health insurance policies also define a medical condition as any illness, injury, or disease except for psychiatric illnesses.\n * As it is more value-neutral than terms like disease, the term medical condition is sometimes preferred by people with health issues that they do not consider deleterious. On the other hand, by emphasizing the medical nature of the condition, this term is sometimes rejected, such as by proponents of the autism rights movement.\n * The term medical condition is also a synonym for medical state, in which case it describes an individual patient's current state from a medical standpoint. This usage appears in statements that describe a patient as being in critical condition, for example.\n * Morbidity is a diseased state, disability, or poor health due to any cause. The term may be used to refer to the existence of any form of disease, or to the degree that the health condition affects the patient.  Among severely ill patients, the level of morbidity is often measured by ICU scoring systems.  Comorbidity is the simultaneous presence of two or more medical conditions, such as schizophrenia and substance abuse.\n * In epidemiology and actuarial science, the term \"morbidity rate\" can refer to either the incidence rate, or the prevalence of a disease or medical condition. This measure of sickness is contrasted with the mortality rate of a condition, which is the proportion of people dying during a given time interval. Morbidity rates are used in actuarial professions, such as health insurance, life insurance and long-term care insurance, to determine the correct premiums to charge to customers. Morbidity rates help insurers predict the likelihood that an insured will contract or develop any number of specified diseases.\n * Pathosis or pathology\n * Pathosis (plural pathoses) is synonymous with disease. The word pathology also has this sense, in which it is commonly used by physicians in the medical literature, although some editors prefer to reserve pathology to its other senses. Sometimes a slight connotative shade causes preference for pathology or pathosis implying \"some [as yet poorly analyzed] pathophysiologic process\" rather than disease implying \"a specific disease entity as defined by diagnostic criteria being already met\". This is hard to quantify denotatively, but it explains why cognitive synonymy is not invariable.\n * Syndrome\n * A syndrome is the association of several medical signs, symptoms, or other characteristics that often occur together. Some syndromes, such as Down syndrome, have only one cause.  Others, such as Parkinsonian syndrome, have multiple possible causes. For example, acute coronary syndrome is not a single disease itself, but rather the manifestation of any of several diseases, such as myocardial infarction secondary to coronary artery disease. In yet other syndromes, the cause is unknown.  A familiar syndrome name often remains in use even after an underlying cause has been found, or when there are a number of different possible primary causes. Examples of the first-mentioned type are that Turner syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome are still often called by the \"syndrome\" name despite that they can also be viewed as disease entities and not solely as sets of signs and symptoms.\n * Predisease\n * Predisease is a subclinical or prodromal vanguard of a disease. Prediabetes and prehypertension are common examples. The nosology or epistemology of predisease is contentious, though, because there is seldom a bright line differentiating a legitimate concern for subclinical/prodromal/premonitory status (on one hand) and conflict of interest–driven disease mongering or medicalization (on the other hand). Identifying legitimate predisease can result in useful preventive measures, such as motivating the person to get a healthy amount of physical exercise, but labeling a healthy person with an unfounded notion of predisease can result in overtreatment, such as taking drugs that only help people with severe disease or paying for drug prescription instances whose benefit–cost ratio is minuscule (placing it in the waste category of CMS' \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" classification). One review summarizes 3 requirements for legitimacy of instances of the concept: truly high risk for progression to disease, actionability for risk reduction, and benefit that outweighs harm in any interventions taken.\n * Predisease\n * Predisease is a subclinical or prodromal vanguard of a disease. Prediabetes and prehypertension are common examples. The nosology or epistemology of predisease is contentious, though, because there is seldom a bright line differentiating a legitimate concern for subclinical/prodromal/premonitory status (on one hand) and conflict of interest–driven disease mongering or medicalization (on the other hand).

One review summarizes 3 requirements for legitimacy of instances of the concept: truly high risk for progression to disease, actionability for risk reduction, and benefit that outweighs harm in any interventions taken.\n\n\n * Mental\n * Mental illness is a broad, generic label for a category of illnesses that may include affective or emotional instability, behavioral dysregulation, cognitive dysfunction or impairment. Specific illnesses known as mental illnesses include major depression, generalized anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, to name a few. Mental illness can be of biological (e.g., anatomical, chemical, or genetic) or psychological (e.g., trauma or conflict) origin. It can impair the affected person's ability to work or study and can harm interpersonal relationships.  The term insanity is used technically as a legal term.\n * Organic\n * An organic disease is one caused by a physical or physiological change to some tissue or organ of the body. The term sometimes excludes infections.  It is commonly used in contrast with mental disorders.  It includes emotional and behavioral disorders if they are due to changes to the physical structures or functioning of the body, such as after a stroke or a traumatic brain injury, but not if they are due to psychosocial issues.\n\nIn an infectious disease, the incubation period is the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms. The latency period is the time between infection and the ability of the disease to spread to another person, which may precede, follow, or be simultaneous with the appearance of symptoms. Some viruses also exhibit a dormant phase, called viral latency, in which the virus hides in the body in an inactive state. For example, varicella zoster virus causes chickenpox in the acute phase; after recovery from chickenpox, the virus may remain dormant in nerve cells for many years, and later cause herpes zoster (shingles). :If a person will die soon from a disease, regardless of whether that disease typically causes death, then the stage between the earlier disease process and active dying is the terminal phase.\n * Acute disease\n * An acute disease is a short-lived disease, like the common cold.\n * Chronic disease\n * A chronic disease is one that lasts for a long time, usually at least six months. During that time, it may be constantly present, or it may go into remission and periodically relapse.  A chronic disease may be stable (does not get any worse) or it may be progressive (gets worse over time).  Some chronic diseases can be permanently cured.  Most chronic diseases can be beneficially treated, even if they cannot be permanently cured.\n * Clinical disease\n * One that has clinical consequences; in other words, the stage of the disease that produces the characteristic signs and symptoms of that disease. AIDS is the clinical disease stage of HIV infection.\n * Cure\n * A cure is the end of a medical condition or a treatment that is very likely to end it, while remission refers to the disappearance, possibly temporarily, of symptoms. Complete remission is the best possible outcome for incurable diseases.\n * Flare-up\n * A flare-up can refer to either the recurrence of symptoms or an onset of more severe symptoms.\n * Progressive disease\n * Progressive disease is a disease whose typical natural course is the worsening of the disease until death, serious debility, or organ failure occurs. Slowly progressive diseases are also chronic diseases; many are also degenerative diseases.  The opposite of progressive disease is stable disease or static disease:  a medical condition that exists, but does not get better or worse.\n * A refractory disease is a disease that resists treatment, especially an individual case that resists treatment more than is normal for the specific disease in question.\n * Subclinical disease\n * Also called silent disease, silent stage, or asymptomatic disease. This is a stage in some diseases before the symptoms are first noted.\n * Terminal phase\n * If a person will die soon from a disease, regardless of whether that disease typically causes death, then the stage between the earlier disease process and active dying is the terminal phase.\n\n\n * Localized disease\n * A localized disease is one that affects only one part of the body, such as athlete's foot or an eye infection.\n * Disseminated disease\n * A disseminated disease has spread to other parts; with cancer, this is usually called metastatic disease.\n * Systemic disease\n * A systemic disease is a disease that affects the entire body, such as influenza or high blood pressure.\n\nDiseases may be classified by cause, pathogenesis (mechanism by which the disease is caused), or by symptom(s). Alternatively, diseases may be classified according to the organ system involved, though this is often complicated since many diseases affect more than one organ.\n\nA chief difficulty in nosology is that diseases often cannot be defined and classified clearly, especially when cause or pathogenesis are unknown. Thus diagnostic terms often only reflect a symptom or set of symptoms (syndrome).\n\nClassical classification of human disease derives from observational correlation between pathological analysis and clinical syndromes. Today it is preferred to classify them by their cause if it is known.\n\nThe most known and used classification of diseases is the World Health Organization's ICD. This is periodically updated. Currently the last publication is the ICD-10.\n\nOnly some diseases such as influenza are contagious and commonly believed infectious. The micro-organisms that cause these diseases are known as pathogens and include varieties of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. Infectious diseases can be transmitted, e.g. by hand-to-mouth contact with infectious material on surfaces, by bites of insects or other carriers of the disease, and from contaminated water or food (often via fecal contamination), etc. Also, there are sexually transmitted diseases. In some cases, microorganisms that are not readily spread from person to person play a role, while other diseases can be prevented or ameliorated with appropriate nutrition or other lifestyle changes.\n\nSome diseases, such as most (but not all) forms of cancer, heart disease, and mental disorders, are non-infectious diseases. Many non-infectious diseases have a partly or completely genetic basis (see genetic disorder) and may thus be transmitted from one generation to another.\n\nSocial determinants of health are the social conditions in which people live that determine their health. Illnesses are generally related to social, economic, political, and environmental circumstances. Social determinants of health have been recognized by several health organizations such as the Public Health Agency of Canada and the World Health Organization to greatly influence collective and personal well-being. The World Health Organization's Social Determinants Council also recognizes Social determinants of health in poverty.\n\nWhen the cause of a disease is poorly understood, societies tend to mythologize the disease or use it as a metaphor or symbol of whatever that culture considers evil. For example, until the bacterial cause of tuberculosis was discovered in 1882, experts variously ascribed the disease to heredity, a sedentary lifestyle, depressed mood, and overindulgence in sex, rich food, or alcohol—all the social ills of the time.\n\nWhen a disease is caused by a pathogen (e.g., when the disease malaria is caused by infection by Plasmodium parasites.), the term disease may be misleadingly used even in the scientific literature in place of its causal agent, the pathogen. This language habit can cause confusion in the communication of the cause-effect principle in epidemiology, and as such it should be strongly discouraged.\n\n\n * Airborne: An airborne disease is any disease that is caused by pathogens and transmitted through the air.\n * Foodborne: Foodborne illness or food poisoning is any illness resulting from the consumption of food contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, toxins, viruses, prions or parasites.\n * Infectious: Infectious diseases, also known as transmissible diseases or communicable diseases, comprise clinically evident illness (i.e., characteristic medical signs or symptoms of disease) resulting from the infection, presence and growth of pathogenic biological agents in an individual host organism. Included in this category are contagious diseases—an infection, such as influenza or the common cold, that commonly spreads from one person to another—and communicable diseases—a disease that can spread from one person to another, but does not necessarily spread through everyday contact.\n * Lifestyle: A lifestyle disease is any disease that appears to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer, especially if the risk factors include behavioral choices like a sedentary lifestyle or a diet high in unhealthful foods such as refined carbohydrates, trans fats, or alcoholic beverages.\n * Non-communicable: A non-communicable disease is a medical condition or disease that is non-transmissible. Non-communicable diseases cannot be spread directly from one person to another.  Heart disease and cancer are examples of non-communicable diseases in humans.\n\nMany diseases and disorders can be prevented through a variety of means. These include sanitation, proper nutrition, adequate exercise, vaccinations and other self-care and public health measures.\n\nMedical therapies or treatments are efforts to cure or improve a disease or other health problem. In the medical field, therapy is synonymous with the word treatment. Among psychologists, the term may refer specifically to psychotherapy or \"talk therapy\". Common treatments include medications, surgery, medical devices, and self-care. Treatments may be provided by an organized health care system, or informally, by the patient or family members.\n\nPreventive healthcare is a way to avoid an injury, sickness, or disease in the first place. A treatment or cure is applied after a medical problem has already started. A treatment attempts to improve or remove a problem, but treatments may not produce permanent cures, especially in chronic diseases. Cures are a subset of treatments that reverse diseases completely or end medical problems permanently. Many diseases that cannot be completely cured are still treatable. Pain management (also called pain medicine) is that branch of medicine employing an interdisciplinary approach to the relief of pain and improvement in the quality of life of those living with pain.\n\nTreatment for medical emergencies must be provided promptly, often through an emergency department or, in less critical situations, through an urgent care facility.\n\nEpidemiology is the study of the factors that cause or encourage diseases. Some diseases are more common in certain geographic areas, among people with certain genetic or socioeconomic characteristics, or at different times of the year.\n\nEpidemiology is considered a cornerstone methodology of public health research, and is highly regarded in evidence-based medicine for identifying risk factors for disease. In the study of communicable and non-communicable diseases, the work of epidemiologists ranges from outbreak investigation to study design, data collection and analysis including the development of statistical models to test hypotheses and the documentation of results for submission to peer-reviewed journals. Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population, a condition known as a syndemic. Epidemiologists rely on a number of other scientific disciplines such as biology (to better understand disease processes), biostatistics (the current raw information available), Geographic Information Science (to store data and map disease patterns) and social science disciplines (to better understand proximate and distal risk factors). Epidemiology can help identify causes as well as guide prevention efforts.\n\nIn studying diseases, epidemiology faces the challenge of defining them. Especially for poorly understood diseases, different groups might use significantly different definitions. Without an agreed-on definition, different researchers may report different numbers of cases and characteristics of the disease.\n\nSome morbidity databases are compiled with data supplied by states and territories health authorities, at national levels or larger scale (such as European Hospital Morbidity Database (HMDB)) which may contain hospital discharge data by detailed diagnosis, age and sex. The European HMDB datea was submitted by European countries to the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe.\n\nDisease burden is the impact of a health problem in an area measured by financial cost, mortality, morbidity, or other indicators.\n\nThere are several measures used to quantify the burden imposed by diseases on people. The years of potential life lost (YPLL) is a simple estimate of the number of years that a person's life was shortened due to a disease. For example, if a person dies at the age of 65 from a disease, and would probably have lived until age 80 without that disease, then that disease has caused a loss of 15 years of potential life. YPLL measurements do not account for how disabled a person is before dying, so the measurement treats a person who dies suddenly and a person who died at the same age after decades of illness as equivalent. In 2004, the World Health Organization calculated that 932 million years of potential life were lost to premature death.\n\nThe quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) metrics are similar, but take into account whether the person was healthy after diagnosis. In addition to the number of years lost due to premature death, these measurements add part of the years lost to being sick. Unlike YPLL, these measurements show the burden imposed on people who are very sick, but who live a normal lifespan. A disease that has high morbidity, but low mortality, has a high DALY and a low YPLL. In 2004, the World Health Organization calculated that 1.5 billion disability-adjusted life years were lost to disease and injury. In the developed world, heart disease and stroke cause the most loss of life, but neuropsychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder cause the most years lost to being sick.\n\n\n\nHow a society responds to diseases is the subject of medical sociology.\n\nA condition may be considered a disease in some cultures or eras but not in others. For example, obesity can represent wealth and abundance, and is a status symbol in famine-prone areas and some places hard-hit by HIV/AIDS. Epilepsy is considered a sign of spiritual gifts among the Hmong people.\n\nSickness confers the social legitimization of certain benefits, such as illness benefits, work avoidance, and being looked after by others. The person who is sick takes on a social role called the sick role. A person who responds to a dreaded disease, such as cancer, in a culturally acceptable fashion may be publicly and privately honored with higher social status. In return for these benefits, the sick person is obligated to seek treatment and work to become well once more. As a comparison, consider pregnancy, which is not interpreted as a disease or sickness, even if the mother and baby may both benefit from medical care.\n\nMost religions grant exceptions from religious duties to people who are sick. For example, one whose life would be endangered by fasting on Yom Kippur or during Ramadan is exempted from the requirement, or even forbidden from participating. People who are sick are also exempted from social duties. For example, ill health is the only socially acceptable reason for an American to refuse an invitation to the White House.\n\nThe identification of a condition as a disease, rather than as simply a variation of human structure or function, can have significant social or economic implications. The controversial recognitions as diseases of repetitive stress injury (RSI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (also known as \"Soldier's heart\", \"shell shock\", and \"combat fatigue\") has had a number of positive and negative effects on the financial and other responsibilities of governments, corporations and institutions towards individuals, as well as on the individuals themselves. The social implication of viewing aging as a disease could be profound, though this classification is not yet widespread.\n\nLepers were people who were historically shunned because they had an infectious disease, and the term \"leper\" still evokes social stigma. Fear of disease can still be a widespread social phenomenon, though not all diseases evoke extreme social stigma.\n\nSocial standing and economic status affect health. Diseases of poverty are diseases that are associated with poverty and low social status; diseases of affluence are diseases that are associated with high social and economic status. Which diseases are associated with which states varies according to time, place, and technology. Some diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, may be associated with both poverty (poor food choices) and affluence (long lifespans and sedentary lifestyles), through different mechanisms. The term lifestyle diseases describes diseases associated with longevity and that are more common among older people. For example, cancer is far more common in societies in which most members live until they reach the age of 80 than in societies in which most members die before they reach the age of 50.\n\nAn illness narrative is a way of organizing a medical experience into a coherent story that illustrates the sick individual's personal experience.\n\nPeople use metaphors to make sense of their experiences with disease. The metaphors move disease from an objective thing that exists to an affective experience. The most popular metaphors draw on military concepts: Disease is an enemy that must be feared, fought, battled, and routed. The patient or the healthcare provider is a warrior, rather than a passive victim or bystander. The agents of communicable diseases are invaders; non-communicable diseases constitute internal insurrection or civil war. Because the threat is urgent, perhaps a matter of life and death, unthinkably radical, even oppressive, measures are society's and the patient's moral duty as they courageously mobilize to struggle against destruction. The War on Cancer is an example of this metaphorical use of language. This language is empowering to some patients, but leaves others feeling like they are failures.\n\nAnother class of metaphors describes the experience of illness as a journey: The person travels to or from a place of disease, and changes himself, discovers new information, or increases his experience along the way. He may travel \"on the road to recovery\" or make changes to \"get on the right track\" or choose \"pathways\". Some are explicitly immigration-themed: the patient has been exiled from the home territory of health to the land of the ill, changing identity and relationships in the process. This language is more common among British healthcare professionals than the language of physical aggression.\n\nSome metaphors are disease-specific. Slavery is a common metaphor for addictions: The alcoholic is enslaved by drink, and the smoker is captive to nicotine. Some cancer patients treat the loss of their hair from chemotherapy as a metonymy or metaphor for all the losses caused by the disease.\n\nSome diseases are used as metaphors for social ills: \"Cancer\" is a common description for anything that is endemic and destructive in society, such as poverty, injustice, or racism. AIDS was seen as a divine judgment for moral decadence, and only by purging itself from the \"pollution\" of the \"invader\" could society become healthy again. More recently, when AIDS seemed less threatening, this type of emotive language was applied to avian flu and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Authors in the 19th century commonly used tuberculosis as a symbol and a metaphor for transcendence. Victims of the disease were portrayed in literature as having risen above daily life to become ephemeral objects of spiritual or artistic achievement. In the 20th century, after its cause was better understood, the same disease became the emblem of poverty, squalor, and other social problems.\n\n","My friend and I's first experience with acid happened May 12 of 2006. We had just gotten out of school so we figured hey, lets get some acid. We'd both done shrooms a couple of times before but that was it for hallucinogens.\n\n7:30AM - we had only gotten a couple of hours of sleep the night before (anticipation) and decided we'd go to the local waffle house for a nice breakfast of Acid and water :) We put the fat blue-stained tabs on our tongues on the way and got our semi-retarded but sober friend to drive us there. Our first indications of anything different were probably about an hour after the drop at the waffle house. With the tabs still on our tongues, we decided to swallow them with water at our table. My friend looked down at a spoon that was next to me and said 'Oh fuck' because my face was starting to 'transform'. I didn't notice any change until we got up to leave, when suddenly I felt really unnaturally tall. The ground was kind of slanted and colors took on a brighter, more vivid effect.\n\nThen it happened. As we got into the car, we went into neverland. All of a sudden it had the effect of a mild mushroom trip and we decided to head for my friend's house because his parents were out. By the time we arrived, it was really starting to hit. Nothing freaked us out at this point even though neither of us had experienced as intense a thing as this before. Once inside, the hallucinations started happening. My first one I'll never forget was lookin at a statue on the mantle and watching it transform into a serpant and slither around. My friend started talkin to the horse head picture on the wall - he said it was pokin out and talking to him. Every aspect of the room seemed to be alive and in its own universe.\n\nOur other friend/sitter decided to go out on the porch and smoke a joint while we continued trippin our balls off. Next stage of the trip, the bathroom. I walked in to take a piss and before I was able to turn on the lights, I had the most intense, realistic hallucinations of people and character's faces coming at me through the darkness. I yelled at my friend to get in there and he saw igniting sparks flying around his head. While our friend was blazing outside we went into the basement to attempt to play pool. HAHAHA. Right. We ended up hunting giraffes on a safari thinkin the pool cue's were spears. Our other sober friend came downstairs and I tried talking to him but I kept seeing things manifest from his face, mainly banana-stalks and images of fruit.\n\nMy trippin friend had left the room to go watch his countertop 'breathe' so I took the opportunity to stick my head into the freezer. Man the images I saw, I can't even describe it. Eventually all 4 of us wound up upstairs and then all hell broke loose. Our beautiful experience was about to turn into a hellish nightmare by the call of one person, my friend's dad. Apparently his dad chose this day of all days to hound his ass on the phone about him not coming home the night before and fully expecting him to be home in a couple of hours. Now we were in trouble - we had planned to stay the entire trip at his house and we had to leave. As if it weren't enough, our friends both bailed on us and so there we were, 2 acid heads outside watching our friends drive away and trying to figure out what to do with poolsticks in our hands.\n\nAfter an eternity of panic (2 real minutes) I called my other friend and told him our situation. We convinced him to drive down and babysit us, so again we were good for about another hour until my friend's dad started calling again. No way could he have talked to him on the phone, we were so far gone from reality at this point that nothing, not even 4 word text messages made sense to us. So began our grand journey. We got our friend to drive us to the local park so we could walk around. We were so fucked up that our only goal was to kill time until we could come down to reality and face society again.\n\nAs soon as we were on the walking/bike path, we noticed our first heavy tracers when bikers would go by and their doubles would keep passing us for another 2 minutes. The jungle had never looked so alive. Everything was moving and breathing, and I think this is where sounds started to mesh with sight and taste. I remember 'tasting' the green of the leaves and hearing the trails of the bikers. Well that lasted about 5 minutes real time (3 hours ours) so we told our friend to drive us anywhere else, which ended up being another park. When we stopped in the parking lot we met another friend who freaked us the fuck out. He kept saying he had a friend who was a sheriff and he was gonna get us arrested and into a drug program.\n\nSo then all of us went to this pizza joint and ordered a large pepperoni. My friend's distorted image of the waitress was beyond ridiculous, he said 'When she put the pizza on the table her face went with it and landed in the middle of the cheese.' By now people's faces were melting and shape-shifting, it was nearly impossible to talk to people, or so we thought, apparently we sounded fine the whole time but we sure as hell didn't feel like we did. There was pizza in front of us and we just couldn't eat - just too fucked up, so its about hour 5 or 6 with no food. Next we, in our brilliancy, decided it would be smart to try to go to a movie just to pass the time. This was the dumbest thing we've ever done. On the way to the theater we happened to see a live car accident as it happened (confirmed by our sober friends), and as if that weren't enough all the times and titles on the theater listings were backwards in real life, which just made us feel more crazier.\n\nBy now we started to get worried that the trip wouldn't end - that's where the panic started. When we walked into the theater, we thought we saw a crowded room with people in every seat, then our friend told us there was only one lady in the very back and suddenly we saw how empty it was. This made us just lose it. The sound meshing of the theater's bass mixed with our howling screams (at the previews) was too much to take. As my friend was busy watching the spindles of light manifest and rotate about the movie screen, I went into the deepest meditative state I've ever been in my life. My eyes were crosseyed and I literally saw what I'd call the spindles of consciousness. Two spinning fibrous greenish tornado beings is the best I can do to describe it. All the while my friend was too freaked out to sit still and started yelling at me in my ear. It sounded like he was a hundred miles away, I could barely hear him I was so far in my own mind. So our sober friend quickly ushered us out and back in the car, 20 dollars wasted on a movie where we didn't even make it past the 3rd preview.\n\nWe went to another friend's house who had just gotten home from school and her parents were gone. We tried hookin up the xbox and playin some halo2, I think I got 26 suicides while seriously trying to play and my friend kept dropping the controller and staring at the ceiling. And then outa nowhere her mom walked in. I can't even tell you the panic. Somehow we talked to her for a few minutes and she left, and then we went outside to the tire swing. This was def. one of the best and scariest parts of the trip. We had our friends wind us up and spin us on the swing, and when we opened our eyes it was like total mind-meltdown, I couldn't even tell you what planet I was on.\n\nSo even longer story short, night came and we were about 14 hours into the trip and still hardcore tripping, I mean tracers and hallucinations, no sign of a comedown. This is what freaked us out the most, everywhere we read had said 12 hours max and we were fucked beyond yesterday. We panicked cause we both were supposed to be home at certain times and we had to get our sober friends to write text messages to our parents telling them we were out for the night. Our best idea at the time was to tell our parents the next day we had been wasted cause anything would be better than them finding out we did acid.\n\n9:45pm and only a small hint of a comedown. our friend said she'd drive us to a local pharmacy and get us some herbal shit. It was supposed to 'detox' us or somethin but we both knew it was bullshit and we couldn't remember how to swallow pills anyway so we stuffed em in our pockets and pretended to take them. When we got back to her house we were way freaking out and decided it was up to us to learn how to 'reintegrate into society'. We tried immitating the other 'humans' aka non-acid-takers we saw in her house by eating muffins and playing cards. That lasted 20 seconds, we were too fucked to tell what our cards were or understand any purpose of the game.\n\n11pm still trippin and we have our original friend from the morning pick us up and take us to his house to crash for the night. In the meantime we had talked to dogs, plotted a genius escape by making our caretakers think we had disappeared and killed each other, and watched the most beautiful sunset you could possibly imagine.\n\nSo back at the house we attempted to go to sleep. 2 in the morning and we knew we were coming down but we still weren't sure when the hell it was all gonna be over. We had told our friend to sleep in the room with us in case his mom would have come down or something but that lazy mullet-haired water-head down syndrom son of a bitch said he wanted to sleep upstairs and that he'd be back in the morning. So after he leaves, we freak out for the last time of the trip and take it upon ourselves to create a 'fake friend' for our comfort lol. We put covers over a bunch of pillows to make it look like someone was asleep on the sofa and for whatever reason it just worked, totally reassured us for the rest of the night.\n\nAbout 4am and we were in and out of sleep, still really restless from almost 20 hours of non-stop tripping and NOTHING to eat all day. The tv was on but anytime we'd see human faces it would just freak us out and remind us how not normal we were, so we put it on the golf channel (and we HATE golf) all night just because there wasn't anything to horrific about watching a ball cross a green. After what seemed to be nine eternities (literally watching the seconds of the clock for hours) we somehow slept for a couple hours and awoke in the morning.\n\nVisuals had returned to normal but the lingering psychosis was still there, we just didn't feel like ourselves. We felt in some way detatched and we didn't think we were ready to go back into society. But we went our separate ways and that was that, followed by the next two days of reintegration. Things and thoughts became normal but it was an agonizingly slow process. The first time I talked to my mom the day after the trip I almost puked I was so nervous, but I sounded fine on the outside.\n\n","Hello! Awake?","Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished citizens and fellow citizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the union. This year, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead.\nYou and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During this session of Congress, we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country; we have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease. We will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared, and we will answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people.\nIn all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident. In a whirlwind of change and hope and peril, our faith is sure, our resolve is firm, and our union is strong.\nThis country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other presidents, and other generations. We will confront them with focus and clarity and courage.\nDuring the last two years, we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together. To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historic education reform — which must now be carried out in every school and in every classroom, so that every child in America can read and learn and succeed in life. To protect our country, we reorganized our government and created the Department of Homeland Security, which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era. To bring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation. To insist on integrity in American business we passed tough reforms, and we are holding corporate criminals to account.\nSome might call this a good record; I call it a good start. Tonight I ask the House and Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens.\nOur first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job. After recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals and stock market declines, our economy is recovering — yet it's not growing fast enough, or strongly enough. With unemployment rising, our nation needs more small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand, more employers to put up the sign that says, \"Help Wanted.\"\nJobs are created when the economy grows; the economy grows when Americans have more money to spend and invest; and the best and fairest way to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax it away in the first place.\nI am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanent and effective this year. And under my plan, as soon as I sign the bill, this extra money will start showing up in workers' paychecks. Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty, we should do it now. Instead of slowly raising the child credit to $1,000, we should send the checks to American families now.\nThe tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes — and it will help our economy immediately: 92 million Americans will keep, this year, an average of almost $1,000 more of their own money. A family of four with an income of $40,000 would see their federal income taxes fall from $1,178 to $45 per year. Our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses.\nYou, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions, and promised them for future years. If this tax relief is good for Americans three, or five, or seven years from now, it is even better for Americans today.\nWe should also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws. It's fair to tax a company's profits. It is not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits. To boost investor confidence, and to help the nearly 10 million senior who receive dividend income, I ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends.\nLower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand. More jobs mean more taxpayers, and higher revenues to our government. The best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth, and to show some spending discipline in Washington, D.C.\nWe must work together to fund only our most important priorities. I will send you a budget that increases discretionary spending by 4 percent next year — about as much as the average family's income is expected to grow. And that is a good benchmark for us. Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks of American families.\nA growing economy and a focus on essential priorities will also be crucial to the future of Social Security. As we continue to work together to keep Social Security sound and reliable, we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and they will own.\nOur second goal is high quality, affordable health care for all Americans. The American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation, with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives. Yet for many people, medical care costs too much — and many have no coverage at all. These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverage and rations care.\nInstead, we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a good insurance policy, choose their own doctors, and seniors and low-income Americans receive the help they need. Instead of bureaucrats and trial lawyers and HMOs, we must put doctors and nurses and patients back in charge of American medicine.\nHealth care reform must begin with Medicare; Medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society. We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to preventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in America.\nSeniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is. And just like you — the members of Congress, and your staffs, and other federal employees — all seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs.\nMy budget will commit an additional $400 billion over the next decade to reform and strengthen Medicare. Leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening Medicare. I urge the members of this new Congress to act this year.\nTo improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes of higher cost, the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued. Because of excessive litigation, everybody pays more for health care, and many parts of America are losing fine doctors. No one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit. I urge the Congress to pass medical liability reform.\nOur third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, while dramatically improving the environment. I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more energy at home. I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70-percent cut in air pollution from power plants over the next 15 years. I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, and burn away millions of acres of treasured forest.\nI urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment and our economy. Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step and protect our environment in ways that generations before us could not have imagined.\nIn this century, the greatest environmental progress will come about not through endless lawsuits or command-and-control regulations, but through technology and innovation. Tonight I'm proposing $1.2 billion in research funding so that America can lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles.\nA single chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy, which can be used to power a car — producing only water, not exhaust fumes. With a new national commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom, so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen, and pollution-free.\nJoin me in this important innovation to make our air significantly cleaner, and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy.\nOur fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems of America. For so many in our country — the homeless and the fatherless, the addicted — the need is great. Yet there's power, wonder-working power, in the goodness and idealism and faith of the American people.\nAmericans are doing the work of compassion every day — visiting prisoners, providing shelter for battered women, bringing companionship to lonely seniors. These good works deserve our praise; they deserve our personal support; and when appropriate, they deserve the assistance of the federal government.\nI urge you to pass both my faith-based initiative and the Citizen Service Act, to encourage acts of compassion that can transform America, one heart and one soul at a time.\nLast year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in the USA Freedom Corps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America. Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens — boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention, and children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad.\nI propose a $450-million initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners. Government will support the training and recruiting of mentors; yet it is the men and women of America who will fill the need. One mentor, one person can change a life forever. And I urge you to be that one person.\nAnother cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds out friendship, ambition, moral conviction, and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire. As a government, we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies and reducing demand through anti-drug education programs. Yet for those already addicted, the fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives. Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it. So tonight I propose a new $600-million program to help an additional 300,000 Americans receive treatment over the next three years.\nOur nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work. One of them is found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A man in the program said, \"God does miracles in people's lives, and you never think it could be you.\" Tonight, let us bring to all Americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope: The miracle of recovery is possible, and it could be you.\nBy caring for children who need mentors, and for addicted men and women who need treatment, we are building a more welcoming society — a culture that values every life. And in this work we must not overlook the weakest among us. I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of their birth and end the practice of partial-birth abortion. And because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment, I ask you to set a high standard for humanity, and pass a law against all human cloning.\nThe qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America also determine our conduct abroad. The American flag stands for more than our power and our interests. Our founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity, the rights of every person, and the possibilities of every life. This conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted, and defend the peace, and confound the designs of evil men.\nIn Afghanistan, we helped liberate an oppressed people. And we will continue helping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and educate all their children — boys and girls. In the Middle East, we will continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine. Across the Earth, America is feeding the hungry — more than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the people of the United States. As our nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer, we must also remember our calling as a blessed country is to make this world better.\nToday, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus — including 3 million children under the age 15. There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection. More than 4 million require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims — only 50,000 — are receiving the medicine they need.\nBecause the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, \"We have no medicines. Many hospitals tell people, you've got AIDS, we can't help you. Go home and die.\" In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words.\nAIDS can be prevented. Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years. And the cost of those drugs has dropped from $12,000 a year to under $300 a year — which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp. Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.\nWe have confronted, and will continue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country. And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa. This comprehensive plan will prevent 7 million new AIDS infections, treat at least 2 million people with life-extending drugs, and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS, and for children orphaned by AIDS.\nI ask the Congress to commit $15 billion over the next five years, including nearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean.\nThis nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature. And this nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the man-made evil of international terrorism.\nThere are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war on terror. There's never a day when I do not learn of another threat, or receive reports of operations in progress, or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers. The war goes on, and we are winning.\nTo date, we've arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of al Qaeda. They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September the 11th attacks; the chief of al Qaeda operations in the Persian Gulf, who planned the bombings of our embassies in East Africa and the USS Cole; an al Qaeda operations chief from Southeast Asia; a former director of al Qaeda's training camps in Afghanistan; a key al Qaeda operative in Europe; a major al Qaeda leader in Yemen. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. Many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way — they are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies.\nWe are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks. America and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the American embassy in Yemen, the American embassy in Singapore, a Saudi military base, ships in the Straits of Hormuz and the Straits the Gibraltar. We've broken al Qaeda cells in Hamburg, Milan, Madrid, London, Paris, as well as, Buffalo, New York.\nWe have the terrorists on the run. We're keeping them on the run. One by one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice.\nAs we fight this war, we will remember where it began — here, in our own country. This government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland. We've intensified security at the borders and ports of entry, posted more than 50,000 newly-trained federal screeners in airports, begun inoculating troops and first responders against smallpox, and are deploying the nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack. And this year, for the first time, we are beginning to field a defense to protect this nation against ballistic missiles.\nI thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bioterrorism, called Project Bioshield. The budget I send you will propose almost $6 billion to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. We must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we must act before the dangers are upon us.\nSince September the 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. The FBI is improving its ability to analyze intelligence, and is transforming itself to meet new threats. Tonight, I am instructing the leaders of the FBI, the CIA, the Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location. Our government must have the very best information possible, and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect all our citizens.\nOur war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power. In the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in Pennsylvania, this nation made a pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle, and whatever the difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men — free people will set the course of history.\nToday, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies, who would use them without the least hesitation.\nThis threat is new; America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century, small groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of America.\nNow, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again, and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again, this nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace, and a world of chaos and constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people, and the hopes of all mankind. And we accept this responsibility.\nAmerica is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers. We have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demand that Iraq disarm. We're strongly supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world. We're working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union, and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction.\nIn all these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process — it is to achieve a result: the end of terrible threats to the civilized world. All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attacks. And we're asking them to join us, and many are doing so. Yet the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others. Whatever action is required, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and security of the American people.\nDifferent threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to see a government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty and human rights and democracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own government and determine their own destiny — and the United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom.\nOn the Korean Peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know that that regime was deceiving the world, and developing those weapons all along. And today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions. America and the world will not be blackmailed.\nAmerica is working with the countries of the region — South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia — to find a peaceful solution, and to show the North Korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship. The North Korean regime will find respect in the world and revival for its people only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions.\nOur nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States.\nTwelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, even while inspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons — not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities.\nAlmost three months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm. He has shown instead utter contempt for the United Nations, and for the opinion of the world. The 108 U.N. inspectors were sent to conduct — were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them as directed. Nothing like this has happened.\nThe United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax — enough doses to kill several million people. He hasn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it.\nThe United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin — enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. He hadn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it.\nOur intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands. He's not accounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them.\nU.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them — despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them.\nFrom three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare agents, and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to hide.\nThe dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary; he is deceiving. From intelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors, sanitizing inspection sites and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses.\nIraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations. Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview. Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say. Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with U.N. inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families.\nYear after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why? The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack.\nWith nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly havoc in that region. And this Congress and the America people must recognize another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of al Qaeda. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help them develop their own.\nBefore September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans — this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known. We will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never comes.\nSome have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option.\nThe dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages — leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained — by torturing children while their parents are made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning.\nAnd tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not surrounding your country — your enemy is ruling your country. And the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation.\nThe world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country, and our friends and our allies. The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary of State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraqi's legal — Iraq's illegal weapons programs, its attempt to hide those weapons from inspectors, and its links to terrorist groups.\nWe will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.\nTonight I have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in or near the Middle East, and some crucial hours may lay ahead. In those hours, the success of our cause will depend on you. Your training has prepared you. Your honor will guide you. You believe in America, and America believes in you.\nSending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a President can make. The technologies of war have changed; the risks and suffering of war have not. For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow. This nation fights reluctantly, because we know the cost and we dread the days of mourning that always come.\nWe seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all. If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means — sparing, in every way we can, the innocent. And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military — and we will prevail.\nAnd as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring to the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies — and freedom.\nMany challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. In two years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril; from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes. And we go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to the right country.\nAmericans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world and to ourselves. America is a strong nation, and honorable in the use of our strength. We exercise power without conquest, and we sacrifice for the liberty of strangers.\nAmericans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity.\nWe Americans have faith in ourselves, but not in ourselves alone. We do not know — we do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life, and all of history.\nMay He guide us now. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.\n","Article 901: Scope and Coverage\n1. This Chapter applies to standards-related measures of a Party, other than those covered by Section B of Chapter Seven (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade in goods or services between the Parties, and to measures of the Parties relating to such measures.\n2. Technical specifications prepared by governmental bodies for production or consumption requirements of such bodies shall be governed exclusively by Chapter Ten (Government Procurement).\nArticle 902: Extent of Obligations\n1. Article 105 (Extent of Obligations) does not apply to this Chapter.\n2. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure observance of Articles 904 through 908 by state or provincial governments and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory.\nArticle 903: Affirmation of Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and Other Agreements\nFurther to Article 103 (Relation to Other Agreements), the Parties affirm with respect to each other their existing rights and obligations relating to standards-related measures under the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and all other international agreements, including environmental and conservation agreements, to which those Parties are party.\nArticle 904: Basic Rights and Obligations\nRight to Take Standards-Related Measures\n1. Each Party may, in accordance with this Agreement, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure, including any such measure relating to safety, the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, and any measure to ensure its enforcement or implementation. Such measures include those to prohibit the importation of a good of another Party or the provision of a service by a service provider of another Party that fails to comply with the applicable requirements of those measures or to complete the Party's approval procedures.\nRight to Establish Level of Protection\n2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, each Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives of safety or the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, establish the levels of protection that it considers appropriate in accordance with Article 907(2).\nNon-Discriminatory Treatment\n3. Each Party shall, in respect of its standards-related measures, accord to goods and service providers of another Party:\n\n(a) national treatment in accordance with Article 301 (Market Access) or Article 1202 (Cross-Border Trade in Services); and\n(b) treatment no less favorable than that it accords to like goods, or in like circumstances to service providers, of any other country.\nUnnecessary Obstacles\n4. No Party may prepare, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure with a view to or with the effect of creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties. An unnecessary obstacle to trade shall not be deemed to be created where:\n\n(a) the demonstrable purpose of the measure is to achieve a legitimate objective; and\n(b) the measure does not operate to exclude goods of another Party that meet that legitimate objective.\nArticle 905: Use of International Standards\n1. Each Party shall use, as a basis for its standards-related measures, relevant international standards or international standards whose completion is imminent, except where such standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means to fulfill its legitimate objectives, for example because of fundamental climatic, geographical, technological or infrastructural factors, scientific justification or the level of protection that the Party considers appropriate.\n2. A Party's standards-related measure that conforms to an international standard shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 904(3) and (4).\n3. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, from adopting, maintaining or applying any standards-related measure that results in a higher level of protection than would be achieved if the measure were based on the relevant international standard.\nArticle 906: Compatibility and Equivalence\n1. Recognizing the crucial role of standards-related measures in achieving legitimate objectives, the Parties shall, in accordance with this Chapter, work jointly to enhance the level of safety and of protection of human, animal and plant life and health, the environment and consumers.\n2. Without reducing the level of safety or of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, without prejudice to the rights of any Party under this Chapter, and taking into account international standardization activities, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable, make compatible their respective standards-related measures, so as to facilitate trade in a good or service between the Parties.\n3. Further to Articles 902 and 905, a Party shall, on request of another Party, seek, through appropriate measures, to promote the compatibility of a specific standard or conformity assessment procedure that is maintained in its territory with the standards or conformity assessment procedures maintained in the territory of the other Party.\n4. Each importing Party shall treat a technical regulation adopted or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with the importing Party, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the importing Party that its technical regulation adequately fulfills the importing Party's legitimate objectives.\n5. The importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party, on request, its reasons in writing for not treating a technical regulation as equivalent under paragraph 4.\n6. Each Party shall, wherever possible, accept the results of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of another Party, provided that it is satisfied that the procedure offers an assurance, equivalent to that provided by a procedure it conducts or a procedure conducted in its territory the results of which it accepts, that the relevant good or service complies with the applicable technical regulation or standard adopted or maintained in the Party's territory.\n7. Prior to accepting the results of a conformity assessment procedure pursuant to paragraph 6, and to enhance confidence in the continued reliability of each other's conformity assessment results, the Parties may consult on such matters as the technical competence of the conformity assessment bodies involved, including verified compliance with relevant international standards through such means as accreditation.\nArticle 907: Assessment of Risk\n1. A Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, conduct an assessment of risk. In conducting an assessment, a Party may take into account, among other factors relating to a good or service:\n\n(a) available scientific evidence or technical information;\n(b) intended end uses;\n(c) processes or production, operating, inspection, sampling or testing methods; or\n(d) environmental conditions.\n2. Where pursuant to Article 904(2) a Party establishes a level of protection that it considers appropriate and conducts an assessment of risk, it should avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions between similar goods or services in the level of protection it considers appropriate, where the distinctions:\n\n(a) result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against goods or service providers of another Party;\n(b) constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties; or\n(c) discriminate between similar goods or services for the same use under the same conditions that pose the same level of risk and provide similar benefits.\n3. Where a Party conducting an assessment of risk determines that available scientific evidence or other information is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a provisional technical regulation on the basis of available relevant information. The Party shall, within a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the assessment of risk is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and, where appropriate, revise the provisional technical regulation in the light of that assessment.\nArticle 908: Conformity Assessment\n1. The Parties shall, further to Article 906 and recognizing the existence of substantial differences in the structure, organization and operation of conformity assessment procedures in their respective territories, make compatible those procedures to the greatest extent practicable.\n2. Recognizing that it should be to the mutual advantage of the Parties concerned and except as set out in Annex 908.2, each Party shall accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies in the territory of another Party on terms no less favorable than those accorded to conformity assessment bodies in its territory.\n3. Each Party shall, with respect to its conformity assessment procedures:\n\n(a) not adopt or maintain any such procedure that is stricter, nor apply the procedure more strictly, than necessary to give it confidence that a good or a service conforms with an applicable technical regulation or standard, taking into account the risks that non-conformity would create;\n(b) initiate and complete the procedure as expeditiously as possible;\n(c) in accordance with Article 904(3), undertake processing of applications in non-discriminatory order;\n(d) publish the normal processing period for each such procedure or communicate the anticipated processing period to an applicant on request;\n(e) ensure that the competent body\n\n(i) on receipt of an application, promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of any deficiency,\n(ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible the results of the conformity assessment procedure in a form that is precise and complete so that the applicant may take any necessary corrective action,\n(iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds as far as practicable with the procedure where the applicant so requests, and\n(iv) informs the applicant, on request, of the status of the application and the reasons for any delay;\n(f) limit the information the applicant is required to supply to that necessary to conduct the procedure and to determine appropriate fees;\n(g) accord confidential or proprietary information arising from, or supplied in connection with, the conduct of the procedure for a good of another Party or for a service provided by a person of another Party\n\n(i) the same treatment as that for a good of the Party or a service provided by a person of the Party, and\n(ii) in any event, treatment that protects an applicant's legitimate commercial interests to the extent provided under the Party's law;\n(h) ensure that any fee it imposes for conducting the procedure is no higher for a good of another Party or a service provider of another Party than is equitable in relation to any such fee imposed for its like goods or service providers or for like goods or service providers of any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and other related costs;\n(i) ensure that the location of facilities at which a conformity assessment procedure is conducted does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent;\n(j) limit the procedure, for a good or service modified subsequent to a determination that the good or service conforms to the applicable technical regulation or standard, to that necessary to determine that the good or service continues to conform to the technical regulation or standard; and\n(k) limit any requirement regarding samples of a good to that which is reasonable, and ensure that the selection of samples does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent.\n4. Each Party shall apply, with such modifications as may be necessary, the relevant provisions of paragraph 3 to its approval procedures.\n5.
