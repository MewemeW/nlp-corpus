["hackaday.com","\nDURING the dread reign of the Cholera in New York, I had accepted the\ninvitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement\nof his _cottage ornee_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around\nus all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling\nin the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books,\nwe should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful\nintelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city.\nNot a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some\nacquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily\nthe loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every\nmessenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.\nThat palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I\ncould neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was\nof a less excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in\nspirits, exerted himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical\nintellect was not at any time affected by unrealities. To the substances\nof terror he was sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no\napprehension.\n\nHis endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into\nwhich I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain\nvolumes which I had found in his library. These were of a character to\nforce into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition\nlay latent in my bosom. I had been reading these books without his\nknowledge, and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible\nimpressions which had been made upon my fancy.\n\nA favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens--a belief\nwhich, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed\nto defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions--he\nmaintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,--I\ncontending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity-\nthat is to say, without apparent traces of suggestion--had in itself the\nunmistakable elements of truth, and was entitled to as much respect\nas that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of\ngenius.\n\nThe fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had\noccurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had\nin it so much of the portentous character, that I might well have been\nexcused for regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time\nso confounded and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could\nmake up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend.\n\nNear the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at\nan open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a\nview of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been\ndenuded by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its\ntrees. My thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to\nthe gloom and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes\nfrom the page, they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an\nobject--upon some living monster of hideous conformation, which very\nrapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally\nin the dense forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I\ndoubted my own sanity--or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and\nmany minutes passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was\nneither mad nor in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which\nI distinctly saw, and calmly surveyed through the whole period of\nits progress), my readers, I fear, will feel more difficulty in being\nconvinced of these points than even I did myself.\n\nEstimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of\nthe large trees near which it passed--the few giants of the forest which\nhad escaped the fury of the land-slide--I concluded it to be far larger\nthan any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line, because\nthe shape of the monster suggested the idea--the hull of one of our\nseventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general\noutline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a\nproboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as\nthe body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was\nan immense quantity of black shaggy hair--more than could have been\nsupplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this\nhair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike\nthose of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending\nforward, parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a\ngigantic staff, thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure\ncrystal and in shape a perfect prism,--it reflected in the most gorgeous\nmanner the rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a\nwedge with the apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs\nof wings--each wing nearly one hundred yards in length--one pair being\nplaced above the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each\nscale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that\nthe upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But\nthe chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a\nDeath’s Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and\nwhich was as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of\nthe body, as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While\nI regarded the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance\non its breast, with a feeling or horror and awe--with a sentiment of\nforthcoming evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of\nthe reason, I perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis\nsuddenly expand themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so\nloud and so expressive of wo, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell\nand as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once,\nfainting, to the floor.\n\nUpon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend\nof what I had seen and heard--and I can scarcely explain what feeling of\nrepugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.\n\nAt length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we\nwere sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition--I\noccupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa\nnear at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to\ngive him an account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end--at first\nlaughed heartily--and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as\nif my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again\nhad a distinct view of the monster--to which, with a shout of absolute\nterror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly--but maintained\nthat he saw nothing--although I designated minutely the course of the\ncreature, as it made its way down the naked face of the hill.\n\nI was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an\nomen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I\nthrew myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried\nmy face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no\nlonger apparent.\n\nMy host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his\ndemeanor, and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the\nconformation of the visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied\nhim on this head, he sighed deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable\nburden, and went on to talk, with what I thought a cruel calmness, of\nvarious points of speculative philosophy, which had heretofore formed\nsubject of discussion between us. I remember his insisting very\nespecially (among other things) upon the idea that the principle\nsource of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of\nthe understanding to under-rate or to over-value the importance of an\nobject, through mere mis-admeasurement of its propinquity. “To estimate\nproperly, for example,” he said, “the influence to be exercised on\nmankind at large by the thorough diffusion of Democracy, the distance\nof the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should\nnot fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can you tell me one writer\non the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch\nof the subject worthy of discussion at all?”\n\nHe here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth\none of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to\nexchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine\nprint of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the\nbook, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.\n\n“But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the\nmonster, I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you\nwhat it was. In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy\naccount of the genus Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order\nLepidoptera, of the class of Insecta--or insects. The account runs thus:\n\n“‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic\nappearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation\nof the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of\nmandibles and downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior\nby a stiff hair; antennae in the form of an elongated club, prismatic;\nabdomen pointed, The Death’s--headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror\namong the vulgar, at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it\nutters, and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”\n\nHe here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing\nhimself accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of\nbeholding “the monster.”\n\n“Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed--“it is reascending the face\nof the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.\nStill, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,--for\nthe fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some\nspider has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the\nsixteenth of an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth\nof an inch distant from the pupil of my eye.”\n\n","This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy  in the cat condo is Jinkies.\nYep.� That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.� Single are ya?\nChandler Bing.\nHey.� How come you're answering your own phone?� Where's your crazy assistant?\nWhat's up Joe?\nOkay, what have we always wanted to do together?\nBraid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?\nNo, no, no.� When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to  be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .� courtside!\nCourtside?� Oh my God.\nYeah.� Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with  his knee.\nThat's so cool.� I'll let Monica know.\nHello?\nJoey just called.� He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and  me tomorrow night.\nReally?� But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.�  If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.\nBut hey, it's courtside.� The cheerleaders are going to be right  in fr. . . � That's not the way to convince you.\nChandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, \"You  can't go to the game.� You have to spend time with me.\"� So, if you could just  realize it on your own . . .\nI know.� You're right.� I want to see you too.� I've just got to  figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?� He's really looking forward to this.\nTell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.� Tell him  that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.� Tell him that  what little time we have is precious.\nYeah, ah, ah . . .� I'll think of something.\nWow!� � Wow, You look . . . uh . . .�� It's just, ah . . .�� That  dress . . . uh . . .�\nWell, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.\nWell, well, they're good.� It's been a while since I've seen you like  this.� You, you clean up good.\nOh well, well thank you.�\nOh right, right.� � So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night  away from Emma?\nYeah, yeah.� Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.� And thank  you for watching the baby, by the way.\nOh, it's fine.� Actually, I, I invited Mike over.\nPhoebe's Mike?\nYeah.\nI didn't know you guys hung out.\nWe don't.� But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.� You know,  maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.\nOh that's so cute:� Ross and Mike's first date.� Is that going to be  awkward?� I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?\nI don't know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.�  He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He's been divorced; I have some  experience in that area.\nYeah.\nHi\nHey.\nOooh.� Girl's night out indeed.\nOk.� So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night,  but if you need anything Ross . . .\nRach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?� You go have fun.\nOkay.� You too.� And I hope you score.� Bye.\nBye.\nSo . . .� Welcome.\nI got beer.\nI got bottled breast milk.\nEh, why don't we start with the beer?\nOkay.� � So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.\nYeah.\nYou know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.\nAh?� � Do you have one here?\nNo.\nOkay.�\nUm . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced.� Um, Phoebe, ah . . .

He had\nbright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long\nbit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the\npond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who\nwas pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand\non their heads in the water.\n\n“You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your\nheads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them\nhow it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They\nwere so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in\nsociety at all.\n\n“What disobedient children!” cried the old Water-rat; “they really\ndeserve to be drowned.”\n\n“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a\nbeginning, and parents cannot be too patient.”\n\n“Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the Water-rat;\n“I am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never\nintend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much\nhigher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or\nrarer than a devoted friendship.”\n\n“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?” asked a\nGreen Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard\nthe conversation.\n\n“Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam away\nto the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her\nchildren a good example.\n\n“What a silly question!” cried the Water-rat.  “I should expect my\ndevoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.”\n\n“And what would you do in return?” said the little bird, swinging upon a\nsilver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.\n\n“I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat.\n\n“Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Is the story about me?” asked the Water-rat.  “If so, I will listen to\nit, for I am extremely fond of fiction.”\n\n“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and\nalighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.\n\n“Once upon a time,” said the Linnet, “there was an honest little fellow\nnamed Hans.”\n\n“Was he very distinguished?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“No,” answered the Linnet, “I don’t think he was distinguished at all,\nexcept for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He\nlived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his\ngarden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.\nSweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds’-purses, and\nFair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac\nCrocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock,\nMarjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil\nand the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the\nmonths went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there\nwere always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.\n\n“Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all\nwas big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to\nlittle Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over\nthe wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or\nfilling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.\n\n“‘Real friends should have everything in common,’ the Miller used to say,\nand little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend\nwith such noble ideas.\n\n“Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich\nMiller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred\nsacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large\nflock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these\nthings, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the\nwonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true\nfriendship.\n\n“So little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the\nsummer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and\nhe had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good\ndeal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper\nbut a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was\nextremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.\n\n“‘There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow\nlasts,’ the Miller used to say to his wife, ‘for when people are in\ntrouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That\nat least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I\nshall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and\nhe will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make\nhim so happy.’\n\n“‘You are certainly very thoughtful about others,’ answered the Wife, as\nshe sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ‘very\nthoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about\nfriendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful\nthings as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear\na gold ring on his little finger.’\n\n“‘But could we not ask little Hans up here?’ said the Miller’s youngest\nson.  ‘If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and\nshow him my white rabbits.’\n\n“‘What a silly boy you are!’ cried the Miller; ‘I really don’t know what\nis the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything.\nWhy, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good\nsupper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is\na most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature.  I certainly\nwill not allow Hans’ nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I\nwill always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any\ntemptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have\nsome flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and\nfriendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words\nare spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can\nsee that.’\n\n“‘How well you talk!’ said the Miller’s Wife, pouring herself out a large\nglass of warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in\nchurch.’\n\n“‘Lots of people act well,’ answered the Miller; ‘but very few people\ntalk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of\nthe two, and much the finer thing also’; and he looked sternly across the\ntable at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his\nhead down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.\nHowever, he was so young that you must excuse him.”\n\n“Is that the end of the story?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Certainly not,” answered the Linnet, “that is the beginning.”\n\n“Then you are quite behind the age,” said the Water-rat.  “Every good\nstory-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the\nbeginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I\nheard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the\npond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am\nsure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head,\nand whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ‘Pooh!’\nBut pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all\nkinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy\nbetween us.”\n\n“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, “as\nsoon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale\nyellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see\nlittle Hans.\n\n“‘Why, what a good heart you have!’ cried his Wife; ‘you are always\nthinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the\nflowers.’\n\n“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron\nchain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.\n\n“‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to\near.\n\n“‘And how have you been all the winter?’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very good\nindeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring\nhas come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.’\n\n“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and\nwondered how you were getting on.’\n\n“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten\nme.’\n\n“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never\nforgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t\nunderstand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking,\nby-the-bye!”\n\n“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky\nthing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the\nmarket and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my\nwheelbarrow with the money.’\n\n“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don’t mean to say you have sold it?\nWhat a very stupid thing to do!’\n\n“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to.  You see the\nwinter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to\nbuy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,\nand then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last\nI sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.’\n\n“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in\nvery good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong\nwith the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I\nknow it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me\nextremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the\nworld.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,\nbesides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your\nmind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.’\n\n“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his funny\nround face glowed all over with pleasure.  ‘I can easily put it in\nrepair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.’\n\n“‘A plank of wood!’ said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want for\nthe roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will\nall get damp if I don’t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is\nquite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given\nyou my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of\ncourse, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,\nfriendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I\nwill set to work at my barn this very day.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the\nplank out.\n\n“‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I am\nafraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left for\nyou to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.\nAnd now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to\ngive me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it\nquite full.’\n\n“‘Quite full?’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a\nvery big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no\nflowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver\nbuttons back.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘as I have given you my\nwheelbarrow, I don’t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.\nI may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true\nfriendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.’\n\n“‘My dear friend, my best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you are welcome to\nall the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion\nthan my silver buttons, any day’; and he ran and plucked all his pretty\nprimroses, and filled the Miller’s basket.\n\n“‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said the Miller, as he went up the hill with\nthe plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.\n\n“‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he\nwas so pleased about the wheelbarrow.\n\n“The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when\nhe heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped\noff the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.\n\n“There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this sack\nof flour for me to market?’\n\n“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day.  I\nhave got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all\nmy grass to roll.’\n\n“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I am\ngoing to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to\nrefuse.’\n\n“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly for\nthe whole world’; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big\nsack on his shoulders.\n\n“It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans\nhad reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down\nand rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the\nmarket.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour\nfor a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was\nafraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.\n\n“‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as he\nwas going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is\nmy best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.’\n\n“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his\nsack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.\n\n“‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy.  Really,\nconsidering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might\nwork harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of\nmy friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite\nplainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not\nyour friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say\nexactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to\nplease and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,\nand does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he\nprefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off\nhis night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for\na little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I\nalways work better after hearing the birds sing?’\n\n“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the\nback, ‘for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed,\nand mend my barn-roof for me.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his\nflowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse\nthe Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.\n\n“‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?’ he\ninquired in a shy and timid voice.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to ask\nof you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of\ncourse if you refuse I will go and do it myself.’\n\n“‘Oh! on no account,’ cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and\ndressed himself, and went up to the barn.\n\n“He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came\nto see how he was getting on.\n\n“‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?’ cried the\nMiller in a cheery voice.\n\n“‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.\n\n“‘Ah!’ said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work one\ndoes for others.’\n\n“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered little\nHans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ‘a very great privilege.\nBut I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.’\n\n“‘Oh! they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take more\npains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you\nwill have the theory also.’\n\n“‘Do you really think I shall?’ asked little Hans.\n\n“‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered the Miller, ‘but now that you have\nmended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive\nmy sheep to the mountain to-morrow.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next\nmorning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans\nstarted off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get\nthere and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to\nsleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.\n\n“‘What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,’ he said, and he went\nto work at once.\n\n“But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his\nfriend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long\nerrands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much\ndistressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had\nforgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller\nwas his best friend.  ‘Besides,’ he used to say, ‘he is going to give me\nhis wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.’\n\n“So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds\nof beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a\nnote-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good\nscholar.\n\n“Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside\nwhen a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind\nwas blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he\nthought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a\nthird, louder than any of the others.\n\n“‘It is some poor traveller,’ said little Hans to himself, and he ran to\nthe door.\n\n“There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the\nother.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ cried the Miller, ‘I am in great trouble.  My little\nboy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the\nDoctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it\nhas just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead\nof me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is\nonly fair that you should do something for me in return.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take it quite as a compliment your\ncoming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your\nlantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the\nditch.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ answered the Miller, ‘but it is my new lantern, and\nit would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.’\n\n“‘Well, never mind, I will do without it,’ cried little Hans, and he took\ndown his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler\nround his throat, and started off.\n\n“What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans\ncould hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely\nstand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking\nabout three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the\ndoor.\n\n“‘Who is there?’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom\nwindow.\n\n“‘Little Hans, Doctor.’\n\n“’What do you want, little Hans?’\n\n“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and\nthe Miller wants you to come at once.’\n\n“‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big\nboots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the\ndirection of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him.\n\n“But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and\nlittle Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.\nAt last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very\ndangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans\nwas drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating\nin a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.\n\n“Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and the\nMiller was the chief mourner.\n\n“‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I\nshould have the best place’; so he walked at the head of the procession\nin a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a\nbig pocket-handkerchief.\n\n“‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the\nBlacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated\ncomfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.\n\n“‘A great loss to me at any rate,’ answered the Miller; ‘why, I had as\ngood as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don’t know what to do\nwith it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair\nthat I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take\ncare not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being\ngenerous.’”\n\n“Well?” said the Water-rat, after a long pause.\n\n“Well, that is the end,” said the Linnet.\n\n“But what became of the Miller?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Oh!  I really don’t know,” replied the Linnet; “and I am sure that I\ndon’t care.”\n\n“It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,” said\nthe Water-rat.\n\n“I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the\nLinnet.\n\n“The what?” screamed the Water-rat.\n\n“The moral.”\n\n“Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Well, really,” said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, “I think you\nshould have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I\ncertainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said\n‘Pooh,’ like the critic.  However, I can say it now”; so he shouted out\n“Pooh” at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back\ninto his hole.\n\n“And how do you like the Water-rat?” asked the Duck, who came paddling up\nsome minutes afterwards.  “He has a great many good points, but for my\nown part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed\nbachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.”\n\n“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet.  “The\nfact is, that I told him a story with a moral.”\n\n“Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,” said the Duck.\n\nAnd I quite agree with her.\n\n","Is there anybody going to listen to my story\nAll about the girl who came to stay?\nShe's the kind of girl you want so much\nIt makes you sorry;\nStill, you don't regret a single day.\nAh girl! Girl! Girl!\n\nShe's the kind of girl who puts you down\nWhen friends are there, you feel a fool.\nWhen you say she's looking good\nShe acts as if it's understood.\nShe's cool, cool, cool, cool.\n\nWhen I think of all the times I've tried to leave her\nShe will turn to me and start to cry;\nAnd she promises the earth to me\nAnd I believe her.\nAfter all this times I don't know why.\n\nWas she told when she was young the pain\nWould lead to pleasure?\nDid she understand it when they said\nThat a man must break his back to earn\nHis day of leisure?\nWill she still believe it when he's dead?\nAh girl! Girl! Girl!\n\n","Article 2001: The Free Trade Commission\n1. The Parties hereby establish the Free Trade Commission, comprising cabinet-level representatives of the Parties or their designees.\n2.

Subject to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, disputes regarding any matter arising under both this Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , any agreement negotiated thereunder, or any successor agreement (GATT), may be settled in either forum at the discretion of the complaining Party.\n2. Before a Party initiates a dispute settlement proceeding in the GATT against another Party on grounds that are substantially equivalent to those available to that Party under this Agreement, that Party shall notify any third Party of its intention. If a third Party wishes to have recourse to dispute settlement procedures under this Agreement regarding the matter, it shall inform promptly the notifying Party and those Parties shall consult with a view to agreement on a single forum. If those Parties cannot agree, the dispute normally shall be settled under this Agreement.\n3. In any dispute referred to in paragraph 1 where the responding Party claims that its action is subject to Article 104 (Relation to Environmental and Conservation Agreements) and requests in writing that the matter be considered under this Agreement, the complaining Party may, in respect of that matter, thereafter have recourse to dispute settlement procedures solely under this Agreement.\n4. In any dispute referred to in paragraph 1 that arises under Section B of Chapter Seven (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) or Chapter Nine (Standards-Related Measures):\n(a) concerning a measure adopted or maintained by a Party to protect its human, animal or plant life or health, or to protect its environment, and\n(b) that raises factual issues concerning the environment, health, safety or conservation, including directly related scientific matters,\nwhere the responding Party requests in writing that the matter be considered under this Agreement, the complaining Party may, in respect of that matter, thereafter have recourse to dispute settlement procedures solely under this Agreement.\n5.

On receipt of such request, the complaining Party shall promptly withdraw from participation in those proceedings and may initiate dispute settlement procedures under Article 2007.\n6. Once dispute settlement procedures have been initiated under Article 2007 or dispute settlement proceedings have been initiated under the GATT, the forum selected shall be used to the exclusion of the other, unless a Party makes a request pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4.\n7. For purposes of this Article, dispute settlement proceedings under the GATT are deemed to be initiated by a Party's request for a panel, such as under Article XXIII:2 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947 , or for a committee investigation, such as under Article 20.1 of the Customs Valuation Code.\nArticle 2006: Consultations\n1.

When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to\ntheir own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to\nallow us lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof\nthirty silver shekels per head!”\n\n“Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the\nRoman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,\nhas no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the\naltar, to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”\n\n“Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who\nbelonged to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints\nwhose manner of _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the\npavement was long a thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees-a\nstumbling-block to less gifted perambulators)--“by the five corners of\nthat beard which, as a priest, I am forbidden to shave!-have we lived\nto see the day when a blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall\naccuse us of appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy\nand consecrated elements? Have we lived to see the day when--“’\n\n“Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted\nAbel-Phittim’ “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice\nor by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest\nofferings should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of\nheaven can not extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can\nturn aside.”\n\nThat part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and\nwhich bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most\nstrongly fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep\nand lofty hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench,\nhewn from the solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength\nerected upon its inner edge. This wall was adorned, at regular\ninterspaces, by square towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the\nhighest one hundred and twenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of\nthe gate of Benjamin, the wall arose by no means from the margin of the\nfosse. On the contrary, between the level of the ditch and the basement\nof the rampart sprang up a perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty\ncubits, forming part of the precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when\nSimeon and his associates arrived on the summit of the tower called\nAdoni-Bezek-the loftiest of all the turrets around about Jerusalem, and\nthe usual place of conference with the besieging army-they looked down\nupon the camp of the enemy from an eminence excelling by many feet that\nof the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by several, that of the temple of Belus.\n\n“Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,\n“the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore-as the locusts\nin the wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of\nAdommin.”\n\n“And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine-no,\nnot one-from Aleph to Tau-from the wilderness to the battlements--who\nseemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”\n\n“Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a\nRoman soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the\nregions of Pluto--“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it\nhas broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince\nyour gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has\nthought fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phoebus,\nwho is a true god, has been charioted for an hour-and were you not to\nbe on the ramparts by sunrise? Aedepol! do you think that we, the\nconquerors of the world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by\nthe walls of every kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower\naway! I say--and see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in\nweight!”\n\n“El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the\ncenturion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away\nagainst the temple--“El Elohim!--who is the god Phoebus?--whom doth the\nblasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of\nthe Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the\nTeraphim!--is it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?---or\nAshimah?--or Nibhaz,--or Tartak?--or Adramalech?--or Anamalech?--or\nSuccoth-Benith?--or Dagon?--or Belial?--or Baal-Perith?--or\nBaal-Peor?--or Baal-Zebub?”\n\n“Verily it is neither-but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too\nrapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang\non the projection of Yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of\nthe holy things of the sanctuary.”\n\nBy the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily\nladen basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and,\nfrom the giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly\nround it; but owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no\ndistinct view of their operations could be obtained.\n\nHalf an hour had already elapsed.\n\n“We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of\nthis period he looked over into the abyss-“we shall be too late! we\nshall be turned out of office by the Katholim.”\n\n “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim---“no more shall we feast upon the fat\nof the land-no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense--our\nloins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”\n\n“Racal” swore Ben-Levi, “Racal do they mean to defraud us of the\npurchase money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the\ntabernacle?”\n\n“They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee-----“they\nhave given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!--and thou,\nBuzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!--for verily the Philistines have either still\nhold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to place\ntherein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while\ntheir burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.\n\n“Booshoh he!”--as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the\nextremity of the rope became indistinctly visible--“Booshoh he!” was the\nexclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.\n\n*****\n\n“Booshoh he!--for shame!--it is a ram from the thickets of Engedi, and as\nrugged as the valley of jehosaphat!”\n\n“It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the\nbleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes\nare more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is\nlike the honey of Hebron.”\n\n“It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee,\n“the heathen have dealt wonderfully with us----let us raise up\nour voices in a psalm--let us give thanks on the shawm and on the\npsaltery-on the harp and on the huggab-on the cythern and on the\nsackbut!”\n\nIt was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the\nGizbarim that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a hog of no\ncommon size.\n\n“Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,\nletting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the\nPhilistines, “El Emanu!-God be with us--it is _the unutterable flesh!”_\n\n","\nA board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or \"board\", according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill.\n\nGames usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve. Early board games represented a battle between two armies, and most modern board games are still based on defeating opponents in terms of counters, winning position, or accrual of points.\n\nThere are many varieties of board games. Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme, like checkers, to having a specific theme and narrative, like Cluedo. Rules can range from the very simple, like Tic-tac-toe, to those describing a game universe in great detail, like Dungeons & Dragons – although most of the latter are role-playing games where the board is secondary to the game, serving to help visualize the game scenario.\n\nThe time required to learn to play or master a game varies greatly from game to game, but is not necessarily correlated with the number or complexity of rules; games like chess or Go possess relatively simple, but have great strategic depth.\n\n\n\nBoard games have been played in most cultures and societies throughout history. A number of important historical sites, artifacts, and documents shed light on early board games such as Jiroft civilization gameboards in Iran. Senet, found in Predynastic and First Dynasty burials of Egypt, c. 3500 BC and 3100 BC respectively, is the oldest board game known to have existed. Senet was pictured in a fresco found in Merknera's tomb (3300–2700 BC). Also from predynastic Egypt is Mehen.\n\nHounds and Jackals another ancient Egyptean board game appeared around 2000 BC. The first complete set of this game was discovered from a Theban tomb that dates to the 13th Dynasty. This game was also popular in Mesopotamia and the Caucasus.\n\nBackgammon originated in ancient Mesopotamia over 5,000 years ago. Chess, Pachisi and Chaupar originated in India. Go and Liubo originated in China. Patolli originated in Mesoamerica played by the ancient Aztec and The Royal Game of Ur was found in the Royal Tombs of Ur, dating to Mesopotamia 4,600 years ago. The earliest known games list is the Buddha games list.\n\n\n\nIn 17th and 18th century colonial America, the agrarian life of the country left little time for game playing though draughts (checkers), bowling, and card games were not unknown. The Pilgrims and Puritans of New England frowned on game playing and viewed dice as instruments of the devil. When the Governor William Bradford discovered a group of non-Puritans playing stool-ball, pitching the bar, and pursuing other sports in the streets on Christmas Day, 1622, he confiscated their implements, reprimanded them, and told them their devotion for the day should be confined to their homes.\n\nIn Thoughts on Lotteries (1826) Thomas Jefferson wrote: Almost all these pursuits of chance [i.e., of human industry] produce something useful to society. But there are some which produce nothing, and endanger the well-being of the individuals engaged in them or of others depending on them. Such are games with cards, dice, billiards, etc. And although the pursuit of them is a matter of natural right, yet society, perceiving the irresistible bent of some of its members to pursue them, and the ruin produced by them to the families depending on these individuals, consider it as a case of insanity, quoad hoc, step in to protect the family and the party himself, as in other cases of insanity, infancy, imbecility, etc., and suppress the pursuit altogether, and the natural right of following it. There are some other games of chance, useful on certain occasions, and injurious only when carried beyond their useful bounds. Such are insurances, lotteries, raffles, etc. These they do not suppress, but take their regulation under their own discretion.\n\nThe board game Traveller's Tour Through the United States and its sister game Traveller's Tour Through Europe were published by New York City bookseller F. & R. Lockwood in 1822 and today claims the distinction of being the first board game published in the United States.\n\nAs the U.S. shifted from agrarian to urban living in the 19th century, greater leisure time and a rise in income became available to the middle class. The American home, once the center of economic production, became the locus of entertainment, enlightenment, and education under the supervision of mothers. Children were encouraged to play board games that developed literacy skills and provided moral instruction.\n\nThe earliest board games published in the United States were based upon Christian morality. The Mansion of Happiness (1843), for example, sent players along a path of virtues and vices that led to the Mansion of Happiness (Heaven). The Game of Pope and Pagan, or The Siege of the Stronghold of Satan by the Christian Army (1844) pitted an image on its board of a Hindu woman committing suttee against missionaries landing on a foreign shore. The missionaries are cast in white as \"the symbol of innocence, temperance, and hope\" while the pope and pagan are cast in black, the color of \"gloom of error, and ... grief at the daily loss of empire\".\n\nCommercially produced board games in the mid-19th century were monochrome prints laboriously hand-colored by teams of low-paid young factory women. Advances in paper making and printmaking during the period enabled the commercial production of relatively inexpensive board games. The most significant advance was the development of chromolithography, a technological achievement that made bold, richly colored images available at affordable prices. Games cost as little as US$.25 for a small boxed card game to $3.00 for more elaborate games.\n\nAmerican Protestants believed a virtuous life led to success, but the belief was challenged mid-century when the country embraced materialism and capitalism. In 1860, The Checkered Game of Life rewarded players for mundane activities such as attending college, marrying, and getting rich. Daily life rather than eternal life became the focus of board games. The game was the first to focus on secular virtues rather than religious virtues, and sold 40,000 copies its first year.\n\nGame of the District Messenger Boy, or Merit Rewarded, published in 1886 by the New York City firm of McLoughlin Brothers, was one of the first board games based on materialism and capitalism published in the United States. The game is a typical track board game. Players move their tokens along the track at the spin of the arrow toward the goal at the track's end. Some spaces on the track will advance the player while others will send him back.\n\nIn the affluent 1880s, Americans witnessed the publication of Algeresque rags to riches games that permitted players to emulate the capitalist heroes of the age. One of the first such games, The Game of the District Messenger Boy, encouraged the idea that the lowliest messenger boy could ascend the corporate ladder to its topmost rung. Such games insinuated that the accumulation of wealth brought increased social status. Competitive capitalistic games culminated in 1935 with Monopoly, the most commercially successful board game in U.S. history.\n\nMcLoughlin Brothers published similar games based on the telegraph boy theme including Game of the Telegraph Boy, or Merit Rewarded (1888). Greg Downey notes in his essay, \"Information Networks and Urban Spaces: The Case of the Telegraph Messenger Boy\", that families who could afford the deluxe version of the game in its chromolithographed, wood-sided box would not \"have sent their sons out for such a rough apprenticeship in the working world.\"\n\nMargaret Hofer described the period of 1880s–1920s as \"The Golden Age\" of board gaming in America. Board game popularity was boosted, like that of many items, through mass production, which made them cheaper and more easily available. Although there are no detailed statistics, some scholars suggest that the 20th century saw a decline in the popularity of the hobby.\n\nThe late 1990s onwards have seen substantial growth in the reach and market of board games. This has been attributed to, among other factors, the Internet, which has made it easier for people to find out about games and to find opponents to play against. Around the year 2000 the board gaming industry began significant growth with companies producing a rising number of new games to be sold to a growing worldwide audience. In the 2010s, a number of publications referred to the board games as having a new Golden Age. Board game venues are also growing in popularity; for example board game cafes are reported to be very popular in China.\n\nSome games, such as chess, depend completely on player skill, while many children's games such as Candy Land and Snakes and Ladders require no decisions by the players and are decided purely by luck.\n\nMany games require some level of both skill and luck. A player may be hampered by bad luck in backgammon, Monopoly, Risk; but over many games a skilled player will win more often, and the elements of luck can make for more excitement, and more diverse and multifaceted strategies, as concepts such as expected value and risk management must be considered.\n\nLuck may be introduced into a game by a number of methods. The use of dice of various sorts goes back to the earliest board games. These can decide everything from how many steps a player moves their token, as in Monopoly, to how their forces fare in battle, as in Risk, or which resources a player gains, as in The Settlers of Catan. Other games such as Sorry! use a deck of special cards that, when shuffled, create randomness. Scrabble does something similar with randomly picked letters. Other games use spinners, timers of random length, or other sources of randomness. German-style board games are notable for often having less luck element than many North American board games.\n\nAnother important aspect of some games is diplomacy, that is, players making deals with one another. Negotiation generally features only in games with three or more players, cooperative games being the exception. An important facet of The Settlers of Catan, for example, is convincing players to trade with you rather than with opponents. In Risk, two or more players may team up against others. Easy diplomacy involves convincing other players that someone else is winning and should therefore be teamed up against. Advanced diplomacy (e.g., in the aptly named game Diplomacy) consists of making elaborate plans together, with the possibility of betrayal.\n\nIn perfect information games, such as chess, each player has complete information on the state of the game, but in other games, such as Tigris and Euphrates or Stratego, some information is hidden from players. This makes finding the best move more difficult, and may involve estimating probabilities by the opponents.\n\nMany board games are now available as video games, which can include the computer playing as one or more opponents. Many board games can now be played online against a computer and/or other players. Some websites allow play in real time and immediately show the opponents' moves, while others use email to notify the players after each move. The Internet and cheaper home printing has also influenced board games via print-and-play games that may be purchased and printed. Some games use external media such as audio cassettes or DVDs in accompaniment to the game.\n\nThere are also virtual tabletop programs that allow online players to play a variety of existing and new board games through tools needed to manipulate the game board, but do not necessarily enforce the game's rules, leaving this up to the players. There are generalized programs such as Vassal, Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia that can be used to play any board or card game, while programs like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds that are more specialized for role-playing games. Some of these virtual tabletops have worked with the license holders to allow for use of their game's assets within the program; for example, Fantasy Grounds has licenses for both Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder materials, while Tabletop Simulator allows game publishers to provide paid downloadable content for their games. However, as these games offer the ability to add in content through user modifications, there are also unlicensed uses of board game assets available through these programs.\n\nWhile the board gaming market is estimated to be smaller than that for video games, it has also experienced significant growth from the late 1990s. A 2012 article in The Guardian described board games as \"making a comeback\". Another from 2014 gave an estimate that put the growth of the board game market at \"between 25% and 40% annually\" since 2010, and described the current time as the \"golden era for board games\". The rise in board game popularity has been attributed to quality improvement (more elegant mechanics,, artwork, and graphics) as well as increased availability thanks to sales through the Internet.\n\nA 1991 estimate for the global board game market was over $1.2 billion. A 2001 estimate for the United States \"board games and puzzle\" market gave a value of under $400 million, and for United Kingdom, of about £50 million. A 2009 estimate for the Korean market was put at 800 million won, and another estimate for the American board game market for the same year was at about $800 million. A 2011 estimate for the Chinese board game market was at over 10 billion yuan. (Some estimates may split board games from collectible card, miniature and role-playing games; for example another 2014 estimate distinguishing board games from other types of hobby games gave the estimate for the U.S. and Canada market at only $75 million, with the total size of what it defined as the hobby game market at over $700 million, with a 2015 estimate suggesting a value of almost $900 million ) A 2013 estimate put the size of the German toy market at 2.7 billion euros (out of which, the board games and puzzle market is worth about 375 million euros), and Polish markets, at 2 billion and 280 million złoties, respectively. Per capita, in 2009 Germany was considered to be the best market, with the highest number of games sold per individual.\n\nA dedicated field of research into gaming exists, known as game studies or ludology.\n\nWhile there has been a fair amount of scientific research on the psychology of older board games (e.g., chess, Go, mancala), less has been done on contemporary board games such as Monopoly, Scrabble, and Risk. Much research has been carried out on chess, in part because many tournament players are publicly ranked in national and international lists, which makes it possible to compare their levels of expertise. The works of Adriaan de Groot, William Chase, Herbert A. Simon, and Fernand Gobet have established that knowledge, more than the ability to anticipate moves, plays an essential role in chess-playing.\n\nLinearly arranged board games have been shown to improve children's spatial numerical understanding. This is because the game is similar to a number line in that they promote a linear understanding of numbers rather than the innate logarithmic one.\n\nResearch studies show that board games such as Snakes and Ladders result in children showing significant improvements in aspects of basic number skills such as counting, recognizing numbers, numerical estimation and number comprehension. They also practice fine motor skills each time they grasp a game piece. Playing board games has also been tied to improving children's executive functions. Related to this is a growing academic interest in the topic of game accessibility, culminating in the development of guidelines for assessing the accessibility of modern tabletop games and the extent to which they are playable for people with disabilities.\n\nAdditionally, board games can be therapeutic. Bruce Halpenny, a games inventor said when interviewed about his game, The Great Train Robbery: With crime you deal with every basic human emotion and also have enough elements to combine action with melodrama. The player's imagination is fired as they plan to rob the train. Because of the gamble they take in the early stage of the game there is a build-up of tension, which is immediately released once the train is robbed. Release of tension is therapeutic and useful in our society, because most jobs are boring and repetitive.\n\nPlaying games has been suggested as a viable addition to traditional educational curriculum.\n\nThere are a number of ways in which board games can be classified, and considerable overlap may exist, so that a game belong in several categories. The following is a list of some of the most common:\n\n","So long ago, certain place, certain time, you touched my hand.\nAll the way down to Emmiline, but if our paths never cross, well you know I'm sorry but if I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.\nI'll never live to match the beauty again, the rainbow's end.\n\nSo it's hard to find someone with that kind of intensity.\nYou touched my hand I played it cool.\n\nSo long ago, it's a certain time, it's a certain place.\nYou touched my hand and you smiled all the way back you held out your hand.\nIf I hope and I pray, ooh it might work out someday.\nIf I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.\nI'll never live to match the beauty again.\n\n","\n\n'One day,' the registrar continued, 'Georgy was ambling out of Melchester\non a miserable screw, the fair being just over, when he saw in front of\nhim a fine-looking young farmer riding out of the town in the same\ndirection.  He was mounted on a good strong handsome animal, worth fifty\nguineas if worth a crown.  When they were going up Bissett Hill, Georgy\nmade it his business to overtake the young farmer.  They passed the time\no' day to one another; Georgy spoke of the state of the roads, and jogged\nalongside the well-mounted stranger in very friendly conversation.  The\nfarmer had not been inclined to say much to Georgy at first, but by\ndegrees he grew quite affable too--as friendly as Georgy was toward him.\nHe told Crookhill that he had been doing business at Melchester fair, and\nwas going on as far as Shottsford-Forum that night, so as to reach\nCasterbridge market the next day.  When they came to Woodyates Inn they\nstopped to bait their horses, and agreed to drink together; with this\nthey got more friendly than ever, and on they went again.  Before they\nhad nearly reached Shottsford it came on to rain, and as they were now\npassing through the village of Trantridge, and it was quite dark, Georgy\npersuaded the young farmer to go no further that night; the rain would\nmost likely give them a chill.  For his part he had heard that the little\ninn here was comfortable, and he meant to stay.  At last the young farmer\nagreed to put up there also; and they dismounted, and entered, and had a\ngood supper together, and talked over their affairs like men who had\nknown and proved each other a long time.  When it was the hour for\nretiring they went upstairs to a double-bedded room which Georgy\nCrookhill had asked the landlord to let them share, so sociable were\nthey.\n\n'Before they fell asleep they talked across the room about one thing and\nanother, running from this to that till the conversation turned upon\ndisguises, and changing clothes for particular ends.  The farmer told\nGeorgy that he had often heard tales of people doing it; but Crookhill\nprofessed to be very ignorant of all such tricks; and soon the young\nfarmer sank into slumber.\n\n'Early in the morning, while the tall young farmer was still asleep (I\ntell the story as 'twas told me), honest Georgy crept out of his bed by\nstealth, and dressed himself in the farmer's clothes, in the pockets of\nthe said clothes being the farmer's money.  Now though Georgy\nparticularly wanted the farmer's nice clothes and nice horse, owing to a\nlittle transaction at the fair which made it desirable that he should not\nbe too easily recognized, his desires had their bounds: he did not wish\nto take his young friend's money, at any rate more of it than was\nnecessary for paying his bill.  This he abstracted, and leaving the\nfarmer's purse containing the rest on the bedroom table, went downstairs.\nThe inn folks had not particularly noticed the faces of their customers,\nand the one or two who were up at this hour had no thought but that\nGeorgy was the farmer; so when he had paid the bill very liberally, and\nsaid he must be off, no objection was made to his getting the farmer's\nhorse saddled for himself; and he rode away upon it as if it were his\nown.\n\n'About half an hour after the young farmer awoke, and looking across the\nroom saw that his friend Georgy had gone away in clothes which didn't\nbelong to him, and had kindly left for himself the seedy ones worn by\nGeorgy.  At this he sat up in a deep thought for some time, instead of\nhastening to give an alarm.  \"The money, the money is gone,\" he said to\nhimself, \"and that's bad.  But so are the clothes.\"\n\n'He then looked upon the table and saw that the money, or most of it, had\nbeen left behind.\n\n'\"Ha, ha, ha!\" he cried, and began to dance about the room.  \"Ha, ha,\nha!\" he said again, and made beautiful smiles to himself in the shaving\nglass and in the brass candlestick; and then swung about his arms for all\nthe world as if he were going through the sword exercise.\n\n'When he had dressed himself in Georgy's clothes and gone downstairs, he\ndid not seem to mind at all that they took him for the other; and even\nwhen he saw that he had been left a bad horse for a good one, he was not\ninclined to cry out.  They told him his friend had paid the bill, at\nwhich he seemed much pleased, and without waiting for breakfast he\nmounted Georgy's horse and rode away likewise, choosing the nearest by-\nlane in preference to the high-road, without knowing that Georgy had\nchosen that by-lane also.\n\n'He had not trotted more than two miles in the personal character of\nGeorgy Crookhill when, suddenly rounding a bend that the lane made\nthereabout, he came upon a man struggling in the hands of two village\nconstables.  It was his friend Georgy, the borrower of his clothes and\nhorse.  But so far was the young farmer from showing any alacrity in\nrushing forward to claim his property that he would have turned the poor\nbeast he rode into the wood adjoining, if he had not been already\nperceived.\n\n'\"Help, help, help!\" cried the constables.  \"Assistance in the name of\nthe Crown!\"\n\n'The young farmer could do nothing but ride forward.  \"What's the\nmatter?\" he inquired, as coolly as he could.\n\n'\"A deserter--a deserter!\" said they.  \"One who's to be tried by court-\nmartial and shot without parley.  He deserted from the Dragoons at\nCheltenham some days ago, and was tracked; but the search-party can't\nfind him anywhere, and we told 'em if we met him we'd hand him on to 'em\nforthwith.  The day after he left the barracks the rascal met a\nrespectable farmer and made him drunk at an inn, and told him what a fine\nsoldier he would make, and coaxed him to change clothes, to see how well\na military uniform would become him.  This the simple farmer did; when\nour deserter said that for a joke he would leave the room and go to the\nlandlady, to see if she would know him in that dress.  He never came\nback, and Farmer Jollice found himself in soldier's clothes, the money in\nhis pockets gone, and, when he got to the stable, his horse gone too.\"\n\n'\"A scoundrel!\" says the young man in Georgy's clothes.  \"And is this the\nwretched caitiff?\" (pointing to Georgy).\n\n'\"No, no!\" cries Georgy, as innocent as a babe of this matter of the\nsoldier's desertion.  \"He's the man!  He was wearing Farmer Jollice's\nsuit o' clothes, and he slept in the same room wi' me, and brought up the\nsubject of changing clothes, which put it into my head to dress myself in\nhis suit before he was awake.  He's got on mine!\"\n\n'\"D'ye hear the villain?\" groans the tall young man to the constables.\n\"Trying to get out of his crime by charging the first innocent man with\nit that he sees!  No, master soldier--that won't do!\"\n\n'\"No, no!  That won't do!\" the constables chimed in.  \"To have the\nimpudence to say such as that, when we caught him in the act almost!  But,\nthank God, we've got the handcuffs on him at last.\"\n\n'\"We have, thank God,\" said the tall young man.  \"Well, I must move on.\nGood luck to ye with your prisoner!\"  And off he went, as fast as his\npoor jade would carry him.\n\n'The constables then, with Georgy handcuffed between 'em, and leading the\nhorse, marched off in the other direction, toward the village where they\nhad been accosted by the escort of soldiers sent to bring the deserter\nback, Georgy groaning: \"I shall be shot, I shall be shot!\"  They had not\ngone more than a mile before they met them.\n\n'\"Hoi, there!\" says the head constable.\n\n'\"Hoi, yerself!\" says the corporal in charge.\n\n'\"We've got your man,\" says the constable.\n\n'\"Where?\" says the corporal.\n\n'\"Here, between us,\" said the constable.  \"Only you don't recognize him\nout o' uniform.\"\n\n'The corporal looked at Georgy hard enough; then shook his head and said\nhe was not the absconder.\n\n'\"But the absconder changed clothes with Farmer Jollice, and took his\nhorse; and this man has 'em, d'ye see!\"\n\n'\"'Tis not our man,\" said the soldiers.  \"He's a tall young fellow with a\nmole on his right cheek, and a military bearing, which this man decidedly\nhas not.\"\n\n'\"I told the two officers of justice that 'twas the other!\" pleaded\nGeorgy.  \"But they wouldn't believe me.\"\n\n'And so it became clear that the missing dragoon was the tall young\nfarmer, and not Georgy Crookhill--a fact which Farmer Jollice himself\ncorroborated when he arrived on the scene.  As Georgy had only robbed the\nrobber, his sentence was comparatively light.  The deserter from the\nDragoons was never traced: his double shift of clothing having been of\nthe greatest advantage to him in getting off; though he left Georgy's\nhorse behind him a few miles ahead, having found the poor creature more\nhindrance than aid.'\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe man from abroad seemed to be less interested in the questionable\ncharacters of Longpuddle and their strange adventures than in the\nordinary inhabitants and the ordinary events, though his local fellow-\ntravellers preferred the former as subjects of discussion.  He now for\nthe first time asked concerning young persons of the opposite sex--or\nrather those who had been young when he left his native land.  His\ninformants, adhering to their own opinion that the remarkable was better\nworth telling than the ordinary, would not allow him to dwell upon the\nsimple chronicles of those who had merely come and gone.  They asked him\nif he remembered Netty Sargent.\n\n'Netty Sargent--I do, just remember her.  She was a young woman living\nwith her uncle when I left, if my childish recollection may be trusted.'\n\n'That was the maid.  She was a oneyer, if you like, sir.  Not any harm in\nher, you know, but up to everything.  You ought to hear how she got the\ncopyhold of her house extended.  Oughtn't he, Mr. Day?'\n\n'He ought,' replied the world-ignored old painter.\n\n'Tell him, Mr. Day.  Nobody can do it better than you, and you know the\nlegal part better than some of us.'\n\nDay apologized, and began:--\n\n\n\nNETTY SARGENT'S COPYHOLD\n\n\n'She continued to live with her uncle, in the lonely house by the copse,\njust as at the time you knew her; a tall spry young woman.  Ah, how well\none can remember her black hair and dancing eyes at that time, and her\nsly way of screwing up her mouth when she meant to tease ye!  Well, she\nwas hardly out of short frocks before the chaps were after her, and by\nlong and by late she was courted by a young man whom perhaps you did not\nknow--Jasper Cliff was his name--and, though she might have had many a\nbetter fellow, he so greatly took her fancy that 'twas Jasper or nobody\nfor her.  He was a selfish customer, always thinking less of what he was\ngoing to do than of what he was going to gain by his doings.  Jasper's\neyes might have been fixed upon Netty, but his mind was upon her uncle's\nhouse; though he was fond of her in his way--I admit that.\n\n'This house, built by her great-great-grandfather, with its garden and\nlittle field, was copyhold--granted upon lives in the old way, and had\nbeen so granted for generations.  Her uncle's was the last life upon the\nproperty; so that at his death, if there was no admittance of new lives,\nit would all fall into the hands of the lord of the manor.  But 'twas\neasy to admit--a slight \"fine,\" as 'twas called, of a few pounds, was\nenough to entitle him to a new deed o' grant by the custom of the manor;\nand the lord could not hinder it.\n\n'Now there could be no better provision for his niece and only relative\nthan a sure house over her head, and Netty's uncle should have seen to\nthe renewal in time, owing to the peculiar custom of forfeiture by the\ndropping of the last life before the new fine was paid; for the Squire\nwas very anxious to get hold of the house and land; and every Sunday when\nthe old man came into the church and passed the Squire's pew, the Squire\nwould say, \"A little weaker in his knees, a little crookeder in his\nback--and the readmittance not applied for: ha! ha!  I shall be able to\nmake a complete clearing of that corner of the manor some day!\"\n\n''Twas extraordinary, now we look back upon it, that old Sargent should\nhave been so dilatory; yet some people are like it; and he put off\ncalling at the Squire's agent's office with the fine week after week,\nsaying to himself, \"I shall have more time next market-day than I have\nnow.\"  One unfortunate hindrance was that he didn't very well like Jasper\nCliff; and as Jasper kept urging Netty, and Netty on that account kept\nurging her uncle, the old man was inclined to postpone the re-liveing as\nlong as he could, to spite the selfish young lover.  At last old Mr.\nSargent fell ill, and then Jasper could bear it no longer: he produced\nthe fine-money himself, and handed it to Netty, and spoke to her plainly.\n\n'\"You and your uncle ought to know better.  You should press him more.\nThere's the money.  If you let the house and ground slip between ye, I\nwon't marry; hang me if I will!  For folks won't deserve a husband that\ncan do such things.\"\n\n'The worried girl took the money and went home, and told her uncle that\nit was no house no husband for her.  Old Mr. Sargent pooh-poohed the\nmoney, for the amount was not worth consideration, but he did now bestir\nhimself; for he saw she was bent upon marrying Jasper, and he did not\nwish to make her unhappy, since she was so determined.  It was much to\nthe Squire's annoyance that he found Sargent had moved in the matter at\nlast; but he could not gainsay it, and the documents were prepared (for\non this manor the copy-holders had writings with their holdings, though\non some manors they had none).  Old Sargent being now too feeble to go to\nthe agent's house, the deed was to be brought to his house signed, and\nhanded over as a receipt for the money; the counterpart to be signed by\nSargent, and sent back to the Squire.\n\n'The agent had promised to call on old Sargent for this purpose at five\no'clock, and Netty put the money into her desk to have it close at hand.\nWhile doing this she heard a slight cry from her uncle, and turning\nround, saw that he had fallen forward in his chair.  She went and lifted\nhim, but he was unconscious; and unconscious he remained.  Neither\nmedicine nor stimulants would bring him to himself.  She had been told\nthat he might possibly go off in that way, and it seemed as if the end\nhad come.  Before she had started for a doctor his face and extremities\ngrew quite cold and white, and she saw that help would be useless.  He\nwas stone-dead.\n\n'Netty's situation rose upon her distracted mind in all its seriousness.\nThe house, garden, and field were lost--by a few hours--and with them a\nhome for herself and her lover.  She would not think so meanly of Jasper\nas to suppose that he would adhere to the resolution declared in a moment\nof impatience; but she trembled, nevertheless.  Why could not her uncle\nhave lived a couple of hours longer, since he had lived so long?  It was\nnow past three o'clock; at five the agent was to call, and, if all had\ngone well, by ten minutes past five the house and holding would have been\nsecurely hers for her own and Jasper's lives, these being two of the\nthree proposed to be added by paying the fine.  How that wretched old\nSquire would rejoice at getting the little tenancy into his hands!  He\ndid not really require it, but constitutionally hated these tiny\ncopyholds and leaseholds and freeholds, which made islands of\nindependence in the fair, smooth ocean of his estates.\n\n'Then an idea struck into the head of Netty how to accomplish her object\nin spite of her uncle's negligence.  It was a dull December afternoon:\nand the first step in her scheme--so the story goes, and I see no reason\nto doubt it--'\n\n''Tis true as the light,' affirmed Christopher Twink.  'I was just\npassing by.'\n\n'The first step in her scheme was to fasten the outer door, to make sure\nof not being interrupted.  Then she set to work by placing her uncle's\nsmall, heavy oak table before the fire; then she went to her uncle's\ncorpse, sitting in the chair as he had died--a stuffed arm-chair, on\ncasters, and rather high in the seat, so it was told me--and wheeled the\nchair, uncle and all, to the table, placing him with his back toward the\nwindow, in the attitude of bending over the said oak table, which I knew\nas a boy as well as I know any piece of furniture in my own house.  On\nthe table she laid the large family Bible open before him, and placed his\nforefinger on the page; and then she opened his eyelids a bit, and put on\nhim his spectacles, so that from behind he appeared for all the world as\nif he were reading the Scriptures.  Then she unfastened the door and sat\ndown, and when it grew dark she lit a candle, and put it on the table\nbeside her uncle's book.\n\n'Folk may well guess how the time passed with her till the agent came,\nand how, when his knock sounded upon the door, she nearly started out of\nher skin--at least that's as it was told me.  Netty promptly went to the\ndoor.\n\n'\"I am sorry, sir,\" she says, under her breath; \"my uncle is not so well\nto-night, and I'm afraid he can't see you.\"\n\n'\"H'm!--that's a pretty tale,\" says the steward.  \"So I've come all this\nway about this trumpery little job for nothing!\"\n\n'\"O no, sir--I hope not,\" says Netty.  \"I suppose the business of\ngranting the new deed can be done just the same?\"\n\n'\"Done?  Certainly not.  He must pay the renewal money, and sign the\nparchment in my presence.\"\n\n'She looked dubious.  \"Uncle is so dreadful nervous about law business,\"\nsays she, \"that, as you know, he's put it off and put it off for years;\nand now to-day really I've feared it would verily drive him out of his\nmind.  His poor three teeth quite chattered when I said to him that you\nwould be here soon with the parchment writing.  He always was afraid of\nagents, and folks that come for rent, and such-like.\"\n\n'\"Poor old fellow--I'm sorry for him.  Well, the thing can't be done\nunless I see him and witness his signature.\"\n\n'\"Suppose, sir, that you see him sign, and he don't see you looking at\nhim?  I'd soothe his nerves by saying you weren't strict about the form\nof witnessing, and didn't wish to come in.  So that it was done in your\nbare presence it would be sufficient, would it not?  As he's such an old,\nshrinking, shivering man, it would be a great considerateness on your\npart if that would do?\"\n\n'\"In my bare presence would do, of course--that's all I come for.  But\nhow can I be a witness without his seeing me?\"\n\n'\"Why, in this way, sir; if you'll oblige me by just stepping here.\"  She\nconducted him a few yards to the left, till they were opposite the\nparlour window.  The blind had been left up purposely, and the candle-\nlight shone out upon the garden bushes.  Within the agent could see, at\nthe other end of the room, the back and side of the old man's head, and\nhis shoulders and arm, sitting with the book and candle before him, and\nhis spectacles on his nose, as she had placed him.\n\n'\"He's reading his Bible, as you see, sir,\" she says, quite in her\nmeekest way.\n\n'\"Yes.  I thought he was a careless sort of man in matters of religion?\"\n\n'\"He always was fond of his Bible,\" Netty assured him.  \"Though I think\nhe's nodding over it just at this moment However, that's natural in an\nold man, and unwell.  Now you could stand here and see him sign, couldn't\nyou, sir, as he's such an invalid?\"\n\n'\"Very well,\" said the agent, lighting a cigar.  \"You have ready by you\nthe merely nominal sum you'll have to pay for the admittance, of course?\"\n\n'\"Yes,\" said Netty.  \"I'll bring it out.\"  She fetched the cash, wrapped\nin paper, and handed it to him, and when he had counted it the steward\ntook from his breast pocket the precious parchments and gave one to her\nto be signed.\n\n'\"Uncle's hand is a little paralyzed,\" she said.  \"And what with his\nbeing half asleep, too, really I don't know what sort of a signature\nhe'll be able to make.\"\n\n'\"Doesn't matter, so that he signs.\"\n\n'\"Might I hold his hand?\"\n\n'\"Ay, hold his hand, my young woman--that will be near enough.\"\n\n'Netty re-entered the house, and the agent continued smoking outside the\nwindow.  Now came the ticklish part of Netty's performance.  The steward\nsaw her put the inkhorn--\"horn,\" says I in my old-fashioned way--the\ninkstand, before her uncle, and touch his elbow as to arouse him, and\nspeak to him, and spread out the deed; when she had pointed to show him\nwhere to sign she dipped the pen and put it into his hand.  To hold his\nhand she artfully stepped behind him, so that the agent could only see a\nlittle bit of his head, and the hand she held; but he saw the old man's\nhand trace his name on the document.  As soon as 'twas done she came out\nto the steward with the parchment in her hand, and the steward signed as\nwitness by the light from the parlour window.  Then he gave her the deed\nsigned by the Squire, and left; and next morning Netty told the\nneighbours that her uncle was dead in his bed.'\n\n'She must have undressed him and put him there.'\n\n'She must.  Oh, that girl had a nerve, I can tell ye!  Well, to cut a\nlong story short, that's how she got back the house and field that were,\nstrictly speaking, gone from her; and by getting them, got her a husband.\n\n'Every virtue has its reward, they say.  Netty had hers for her ingenious\ncontrivance to gain Jasper.  Two years after they were married he took to\nbeating her--not hard, you know; just a smack or two, enough to set her\nin a temper, and let out to the neighbours what she had done to win him,\nand how she repented of her pains.  When the old Squire was dead, and his\nson came into the property, this confession of hers began to be whispered\nabout.  But Netty was a pretty young woman, and the Squire's son was a\npretty young man at that time, and wider-minded than his father, having\nno objection to little holdings; and he never took any proceedings\nagainst her.'\n\nThere was now a lull in the discourse, and soon the van descended the\nhill leading into the long straggling village.  When the houses were\nreached the passengers dropped off one by one, each at his or her own\ndoor.  Arrived at the inn, the returned emigrant secured a bed, and\nhaving eaten a light meal, sallied forth upon the scene he had known so\nwell in his early days.  Though flooded with the light of the rising\nmoon, none of the objects wore the attractiveness in this their real\npresentation that had ever accompanied their images in the field of his\nimagination when he was more than two thousand miles removed from them.\nThe peculiar charm attaching to an old village in an old country, as seen\nby the eyes of an absolute foreigner, was lowered in his case by\nmagnified expectations from infantine memories.  He walked on, looking at\nthis chimney and that old wall, till he came to the churchyard, which he\nentered.\n\nThe head-stones, whitened by the moon, were easily decipherable; and now\nfor the first time Lackland began to feel himself amid the village\ncommunity that he had left behind him five-and-thirty years before.  Here,\nbesides the Sallets, the Darths, the Pawles, the Privetts, the Sargents,\nand others of whom he had just heard, were names he remembered even\nbetter than those: the Jickses, and the Crosses, and the Knights, and the\nOlds.  Doubtless representatives of these families, or some of them, were\nyet among the living; but to him they would all be as strangers.  Far\nfrom finding his heart ready-supplied with roots and tendrils here, he\nperceived that in returning to this spot it would be incumbent upon him\nto re-establish himself from the beginning, precisely as though he had\nnever known the place, nor it him.  Time had not condescended to wait his\npleasure, nor local life his greeting.\n\nThe figure of Mr. Lackland was seen at the inn, and in the village\nstreet, and in the fields and lanes about Upper Longpuddle, for a few\ndays after his arrival, and then, ghost-like, it silently disappeared.  He\nhad told some of the villagers that his immediate purpose in coming had\nbeen fulfilled by a sight of the place, and by conversation with its\ninhabitants: but that his ulterior purpose--of coming to spend his latter\ndays among them--would probably never be carried out.  It is now a dozen\nor fifteen years since his visit was paid, and his face has not again\nbeen seen.\n\n","Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, fellow citizens: fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this Chamber that “the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress.… It is my task,” he said, “to report the State of the Union – to improve it is the task of us all.”\nTonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report. After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home. After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs. We buy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than we have in twenty. Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before.\nTogether, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger. But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded. Our economy is adding jobs – but too many people still can’t find full-time employment. Corporate profits have rocketed to all-time highs – but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged.\nIt is our generation’s task, then, to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth – a rising, thriving middle class. It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country – the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love. It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation.\nThe American people don’t expect government to solve every problem. They don’t expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue. But they do expect us to put the nation’s interests before party. They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together; and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all.\nOur work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget – decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery. Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion – mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1% of Americans. As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4-trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances. Now we need to finish the job. And the question is: how?\nIn 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn’t agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars’ worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year. These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness. They’d devastate priorities like education, energy, and medical research. They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs. That’s why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as “the sequester,” are a really bad idea.\nNow, some in this Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training, Medicare and Social Security benefits. That idea is even worse. Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population. And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms – otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.\nBut we can’t ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and most powerful. We won’t grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers, cops, and firefighters. Most Americans – Democrats, Republicans, and Independents – understand that we can’t just cut our way to prosperity. They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share. And that’s the approach I offer tonight.\nOn Medicare, I’m prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission. Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs. The reforms I’m proposing go even further. We’ll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors. We’ll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn’t be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital – they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive. And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don’t violate the guarantee of a secure retirement. Our government shouldn’t make promises we cannot keep – but we must keep the promises we’ve already made.\nTo hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and well-connected. After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks? How is that fair? How does that promote growth?\nNow is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit. The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring; a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can’t pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in America. That’s what tax reform can deliver. That’s what we can do together.\nI realize that tax reform and entitlement reform won’t be easy. The politics will be hard for both sides. None of us will get 100% of what we want. But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, and visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans. So let’s set party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future. And let’s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors. The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. Let’s agree, right here, right now, to keep the people’s government open, pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America. The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another.\nNow, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda. But let’s be clear: deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs – that must be the North Star that guides our efforts. Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?\nA year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than one million new jobs. I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda, and I urge this Congress to pass the rest. Tonight, I’ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just eighteen months ago. Let me repeat – nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.\nOur first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing. After shedding jobs for more than ten years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After locating plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.\nThere are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend. Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio. A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything. There’s no reason this can’t happen in other towns. So tonight, I’m announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Departments of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs. And I ask this Congress to help create a network of fifteen of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is Made in America.\nIf we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas. Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy. Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s; developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries ten times more powerful. Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation. Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race. And today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy.\nAfter years of talking about it, we are finally poised to control our own energy future. We produce more oil at home than we have in fifteen years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar – with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show for it. We produce more natural gas than ever before – and nearly everyone’s energy bill is lower because of it. And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen.\nBut for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change. Yes, it’s true that no single event makes a trend. But the fact is, the twelve hottest years on record have all come in the last fifteen. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods – all are now more frequent and intense. We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen, were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science, and act before it’s too late.\nThe good news is: we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth. I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.\nFour years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it. We’ve begun to change that. Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America. So let’s generate even more. Solar energy gets cheaper by the year – so let’s drive costs down even further. As long as countries like China keep going all-in on clean energy, so must we. In the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence. That’s why my Administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits. But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and water.\nIndeed, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together. So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good. If a non-partisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we. Let’s take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we’ve put up with for far too long. I’m also issuing a new goal for America: let’s cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next twenty years. The states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make it happen.\nAmerica’s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair. Ask any CEO where they’d rather locate and hire: a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-speed rail and internet; high-tech schools and self-healing power grids. The CEO of Siemens America – a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina – has said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they’ll bring even more jobs. And I know that you want these job-creating projects in your districts. I’ve seen you all at the ribbon-cuttings.\nTonight, I propose a “Fix-It-First” program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure taxpayers don’t shoulder the whole burden, I’m also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods; modern pipelines to withstand a storm; modern schools worthy of our children. Let’s prove that there is no better place to do business than the United States of America. And let’s start right away.\nPart of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector. Today, our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years, home purchases are up nearly 50%, and construction is expanding again. But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected. Too many families who have never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no. That’s holding our entire economy back, and we need to fix it. Right now, there’s a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today’s rates. Democrats and Republicans have supported it before. What are we waiting for? Take a vote, and send me that bill. Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home. What’s holding us back? Let’s streamline the process, and help our economy grow.\nThese initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, and housing will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs. But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs. And that has to start at the earliest possible age. Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road. But today, fewer than three in ten four year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program. Most middle-class parents can’t afford a few hundred bucks a week for private preschool. And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives.\nTonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every child in America. Every dollar we invest in high-quality early education can save more than seven dollars later on – by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime. In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, and form more stable families of their own. So let’s do what works, and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind. Let’s give our kids that chance.\nLet’s also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job. Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges, so that they’re ready for a job. At schools like P-Tech in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York Public Schools, the City University of New York, and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate degree in computers or engineering.\nWe need to give every American student opportunities like this. Four years ago, we started Race to the Top – a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, for about 1% of what we spend on education each year. Tonight, I’m announcing a new challenge to redesign America’s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. We’ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering, and math – the skills today’s employers are looking for to fill jobs right now and in the future.\nNow, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education. It’s a simple fact: the more education you have, the more likely you are to have a job and work your way into the middle class. But today, skyrocketing costs price way too many young people out of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt.\nThrough tax credits, grants, and better loans, we have made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years. But taxpayers cannot continue to subsidize the soaring cost of higher education. Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it’s our job to make sure they do. Tonight, I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act, so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid. And tomorrow, my Administration will release a new College Scorecard that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria: where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.\nTo grow our middle class, our citizens must have access to the education and training that today’s jobs require. But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who’s willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead. Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants. And right now, leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, and faith communities all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Real reform means strong border security, and we can build on the progress my Administration has already made – putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history, and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.\nReal reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship – a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally. And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods, reduce bureaucracy, and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy. In other words, we know what needs to be done. As we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts. Now let’s get this done. Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away.\nBut we can’t stop there. We know our economy is stronger when our wives, mothers, and daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace, and free from the fear of domestic violence. Today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago. I urge the House to do the same. And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year.\nWe know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day’s work with honest wages. But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year. Even with the tax relief we’ve put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line. That’s wrong. That’s why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, nineteen states have chosen to bump theirs even higher.\nTonight, let’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to nine dollars an hour. This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families. It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead. For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets. In fact, working folks shouldn’t have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher. So here’s an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year: let’s tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on.\nTonight, let’s also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it’s virtually impossible to get ahead. Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up. Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job. America is not a place where chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny. And that is why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them.\nLet’s offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who’ve got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance. Let’s put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods. And this year, my Administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet. We’ll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety, education, and housing. We’ll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest. And we’ll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and doing more to encourage fatherhood – because what makes you a man isn’t the ability to conceive a child; it’s having the courage to raise one.\nStronger families. Stronger communities. A stronger America. It is this kind of prosperity – broad, shared, and built on a thriving middle class – that has always been the source of our progress at home. It is also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world.\nTonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us. Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan, and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda. Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women. This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead. Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This drawdown will continue. And by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over.\nBeyond 2014, America’s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change. We are negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counter-terrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates.\nToday, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self. Different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged – from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. The threat these groups pose is evolving. But to meet this threat, we don’t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad, or occupy other nations. Instead, we will need to help countries like Yemen, Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali. And, where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.\nAs we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. That is why my Administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism operations. Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts. I recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word that we’re doing things the right way. So, in the months ahead, I will continue to engage with Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention, and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world.\nOf course, our challenges don’t end with al Qaeda. America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world’s most dangerous weapons. The regime in North Korea must know that they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations. Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only isolate them further, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense, and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats.\nLikewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. At the same time, we will engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands – because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead.\nAmerica must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks. We know hackers steal people’s identities and infiltrate private e-mail. We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets. Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, and our air traffic control systems. We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy.\nThat’s why, earlier today, I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy. Now, Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks.\nEven as we protect our people, we should remember that today’s world presents not only dangers, but opportunities. To boost American exports, support American jobs, and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership. And tonight, I am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union – because trade that is free and fair across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs.\nWe also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all. In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a day. So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades: by connecting more people to the global economy and empowering women; by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping communities to feed, power, and educate themselves; by saving the world’s children from preventable deaths; and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation.\nAbove all, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change. I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon – when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said, “There is justice and law in the United States. I want our country to be like that.”\nIn defense of freedom, we will remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa; from Europe to Asia. In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and support stable transitions to democracy. The process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt; but we can – and will – insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people. We will keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people, and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian. And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace. These are the messages I will deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month.\nAnd all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk: our diplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. As long as I’m Commander-in-Chief, we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military the world has ever known. We'll invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending. We will ensure equal treatment for all service members, and equal benefits for their families, gay and straight. We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat. We will keep faith with our veterans, investing in world-class care, including mental health care, for our wounded warriors; supporting our military families; giving our veterans the benefits, education, and job opportunities that they have earned. And I want to thank my wife Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they have serve us. Thank you, honey. Thank you, Jill.\nDefending our freedom, though, is not just the job of our military alone. We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at home. That includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy: the right to vote. Now, when any American – no matter where they live or what their party – are denied that right because they can’t afford to wait for five, six, seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals. So tonight I’m announcing a non-partisan commission to improve the voting experience in America, and it definitely needs improvement. And I’m asking two long-time experts in the field, who, by the way, recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney’s campaign, to lead it. We can fix this, and we will. The American people demand it, and so does our democracy.\nOf course, what I’ve said tonight matters little if we don’t come together to protect our most precious resource: our children.\nIt has been two months since Newtown. I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence. But this time is different. Overwhelming majorities of Americans – Americans who believe in the 2nd Amendment – have come together around commonsense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they're tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned.\nEach of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. Now if you want to vote no, that’s your choice. But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun. More than a thousand.\nOne of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton. She was fifteen years old. She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. She was a majorette. She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend. Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration. And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house. Hadiya’s parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence. They deserve a vote. They deserve a vote.\nGabby Giffords deserves a vote.\nThe families of Newtown deserve a vote.\nThe families of Aurora deserve a vote.\nThe families of Oak Creek, and Tucson, and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence – they deserve a simple vote.\nOur actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country. Indeed, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I’ve outlined tonight. But we were never sent here to be perfect. We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this nation, expand opportunity, and uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government. We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all across this country. We should follow their example.\nWe should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez. When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, she wasn't thinking about how her own home was faring – they were with the twenty precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe.\nWe should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor. When she arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to vote might be six hours. And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to have their say. Hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line in support of her. Because Desiline is 102 years old. And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read “I Voted.”\nWe should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy. When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, and Brian was the first to arrive, he did not consider his own safety. He fought back until help arrived, and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the fellow Americans worshiping inside – even as he lay bleeding from twelve bullet wounds. And when asked how he did that, Brian said, “That’s just the way we’re made.” That’s just the way we’re made. We may do different jobs, and wear different uniforms, and hold different views than the person beside us. But as Americans, we all share the same proud title:\nWe are citizens.\nIt’s a word that doesn’t just describe our nationality or our legal status. It describes the way we’re made. It describes what we believe. It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter of our American story.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\n","Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:\nAmerica this evening is a Nation called to great responsibilities. And we are rising to meet them.\nAs we gather tonight, hundreds of thousands of American servicemen and women are deployed across the world in the war on terror. By bringing hope to the oppressed, and delivering justice to the violent, they are making America more secure.\nEach day, law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are tracking terrorist threats; analysts are examining airline passenger lists; the men and women of our new Homeland Security Department are patrolling our coasts and borders. And their vigilance is protecting America.\nAmericans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world. The American economy is growing stronger. The tax relief you passed is working.\nTonight, Members of Congress can take pride in great works of compassion and reform that skeptics had thought impossible. You are raising the standards of our public schools; and you are giving our senior citizens prescription drug coverage under Medicare.\nWe have faced serious challenges together - and now we face a choice. We can go forward with confidence and resolve - or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us. We can press on with economic growth, and reforms in education and Medicare - or we can turn back to the old policies and old divisions.\nWe have not come all this way - through tragedy, and trial, and war - only to falter and leave our work unfinished. Americans are rising to the tasks of history, and they expect the same of us. In their efforts, their enterprise, and their character, the American people are showing that the state of our Union is confident and strong.\nOur greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American people. Twenty-eight months have passed since September 11th, 2001 - over two years without an attack on American soil - and it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us. That hope is understandable, comforting - and false. The killing has continued in Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Riyadh, Mombassa, Jerusalem, Istanbul, and Baghdad. The terrorists continue to plot against America and the civilized world. And by our will and courage, this danger will be defeated.\nInside the United States, where the war began, we must continue to give homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend us. And one of those essential tools is the PATRIOT Act, which allows Federal law enforcement to better share information, to track terrorists, to disrupt their cells, and to seize their assets. For years, we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers. If these methods are good for hunting criminals, they are even more important for hunting terrorists. Key provisions of the PATRIOT Act are set to expire next year. The terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule. Our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens - you need to renew the PATRIOT Act.\nAmerica is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war. Last March, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a mastermind of September 11th, awoke to find himself in the custody of U.S. and Pakistani authorities. Last August 11th brought the capture of the terrorist Hambali, who was a key player in the attack in Indonesia that killed over 200 people. We are tracking al-Qaida around the world - and nearly two-thirds of their known leaders have now been captured or killed. Thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on a manhunt, going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves - and, one by one, we will bring the terrorists to justice.\nAs part of the offensive against terror, we are also confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists, and could supply them with nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. The United States and our allies are determined: We refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger.\nThe first to see our determination were the Taliban, who made Afghanistan the primary training base of al-Qaida killers. As of this month, that country has a new constitution, guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women. Businesses are opening, health care centers are being established, and the boys and girls of Afghanistan are back in school. With help from the new Afghan Army, our coalition is leading aggressive raids against surviving members of the Taliban and al-Qaida. The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nation that is free, and proud, and fighting terror - and America is honored to be their friend.\nSince we last met in this chamber, combat forces of the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Poland, and other countries enforced the demands of the United Nations, ended the rule of Saddam Hussein - and the people of Iraq are free. Having broken the Baathist regime, we face a remnant of violent Saddam supporters. Men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows.\nThese killers, joined by foreign terrorists, are a serious, continuing danger. Yet we are making progress against them. The once all-powerful ruler of Iraq was found in a hole, and now sits in a prison cell. Of the top 55 officials of the former regime, we have captured or killed 45. Our forces are on the offensive, leading over 1,600 patrols a day, and conducting an average of 180 raids every week. We are dealing with these thugs in Iraq, just as surely as we dealt with Saddam Hussein's evil regime.\nThe work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right. And America has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right. Last January, Iraq's only law was the whim of one brutal man. Today our coalition is working with the Iraqi Governing Council to draft a basic law, with a bill of rights. We are working with Iraqis and the United Nations to prepare for a transition to full Iraqi sovereignty by the end of June. As democracy takes hold in Iraq, the enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear. They are trying to shake the will of our country and our friends - but the United States of America will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins. The killers will fail, and the Iraqi people will live in freedom.\nMonth by month, Iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own security and their own future. And tonight we are honored to welcome one of Iraq's most respected leaders: the current President of the Iraqi Governing Council, Adnan Pachachi. Sir, America stands with you and the Iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation.\nBecause of American leadership and resolve, the world is changing for the better. Last month, the leader of Libya voluntarily pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his regime's weapons of mass destruction programs, including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons. Colonel Qadhafi correctly judged that his country would be better off, and far more secure, without weapons of mass murder. Nine months of intense negotiations involving the United States and Great Britain succeeded with Libya, while 12 years of diplomacy with Iraq did not. And one reason is clear: For diplomacy to be effective, words must be credible - and no one can now doubt the word of America.\nDifferent threats require different strategies. Along with nations in the region, we are insisting that North Korea eliminate its nuclear program. America and the international community are demanding that Iran meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons. America is committed to keeping the world's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the world's most dangerous regimes.\nWhen I came to this rostrum on September 20th, 2001, I brought the police shield of a fallen officer, my reminder of lives that ended, and a task that does not end. I gave to you and to all Americans my complete commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies. And this pledge, given by one, has been kept by many. You in the Congress have provided the resources for our defense, and cast the difficult votes of war and peace. Our closest allies have been unwavering. America's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been skilled and tireless.\nd the men and women of the American military - they have taken the hardest duty. We have seen their skill and courage in armored charges, and midnight raids, and lonely hours on faithful watch. We have seen the joy when they return, and felt the sorrow when one is lost. I have had the honor of meeting our servicemen and women at many posts, from the deck of a carrier in the Pacific, to a mess hall in Baghdad. Many of our troops are listening tonight. And I want you and your families to know: America is proud of you. And my Administration, and this Congress, will give you the resources you need to fight and win the war on terror.\nI know that some people question if America is really in a war at all. They view terrorism more as a crime - a problem to be solved mainly with law enforcement and indictments. After the World Trade Center was first attacked in 1993, some of the guilty were indicted, tried, convicted, and sent to prison. But the matter was not settled. The terrorists were still training and plotting in other nations, and drawing up more ambitious plans. After the chaos and carnage of September 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers. The terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States - and war is what they got.\nSome in this chamber, and in our country, did not support the liberation of Iraq. Objections to war often come from principled motives. But let us be candid about the consequences of leaving Saddam Hussein in power. We are seeking all the facts - already the Kay Report identified dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related program activities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations. Had we failed to act, the dictator's weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day. Had we failed to act, Security Council resolutions on Iraq would have been revealed as empty threats, weakening the United Nations and encouraging defiance by dictators around the world. Iraq's torture chambers would still be filled with victims - terrified and innocent. The killing fields of Iraq - where hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children vanished into the sands - would still be known only to the killers. For all who love freedom and peace, the world without Saddam Hussein's regime is a better and safer place.\nSome critics have said our duties in Iraq must be internationalized. This particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in Britain, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Italy, Spain, Poland, Denmark, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Netherlands, Norway, El Salvador, and the 17 other countries that have committed troops to Iraq. As we debate at home, we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners, or dismiss their sacrifices. From the beginning, America has sought international support for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have gained much support. There is a difference, however, between leading a coalition of many nations, and submitting to the objections of a few. America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people.\nWe also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater Middle East, where freedom is rare. Yet it is mistaken, and condescending, to assume that whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and self-government. I believe that God has planted in every heart the desire to live in freedom. And even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades, it will rise again.\nAs long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny, despair, and anger, it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of America and our friends. So America is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater Middle East. We will challenge the enemies of reform, confront the allies of terror, and expect a higher standard from our friends. To cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda, the Voice of America and other broadcast services are expanding their programming in Arabic and Persian - and soon, a new television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the region. I will send you a proposal to double the budget of the National Endowment for Democracy, and to focus its new work on the development of free elections, free markets, free press, and free labor unions in the Middle East. And above all, we will finish the historic work of democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq, so those nations can light the way for others, and help transform a troubled part of the world.\nAmerica is a Nation with a mission - and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs. We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire. Our aim is a democratic peace - a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman. America acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side, yet we understand our special calling: This great Republic will lead the cause of freedom.\nIn these last three years, adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths of the American economy. We have come through recession, and terrorist attack, and corporate scandals, and the uncertainties of war. And because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief, this economy is strong, and growing stronger.\nYou have doubled the child tax credit from 500 to a thousand dollars, reduced the marriage penalty, begun to phase out the death tax, reduced taxes on capital gains and stock dividends, cut taxes on small businesses, and you have lowered taxes for every American who pays income taxes.\nAmericans took those dollars and put them to work, driving this economy forward. The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years. New home construction: the highest in almost 20 years. Home ownership rates: the highest ever. Manufacturing activity is increasing. Inflation is low. Interest rates are low. Exports are growing. Productivity is high. And jobs are on the rise.\nThese numbers confirm that the American people are using their money far better than government would have - and you were right to return it.\nAmerica's growing economy is also a changing economy. As technology transforms the way almost every job is done, America becomes more productive, and workers need new skills. Much of our job growth will be found in high-skilled fields like health care and biotechnology. So we must respond by helping more Americans gain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy.\nAll skills begin with the basics of reading and math, which are supposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools. Yet for too long, for too many children, those skills were never mastered. By passing the No Child Left Behind Act, you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country. We are providing more funding for our schools - a 36 percent increase since 2001. We are requiring higher standards. We are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals. We are reporting results to parents, and making sure they have better options when schools are not performing. We are making progress toward excellence for every child.\nBut the status quo always has defenders. Some want to undermine the No Child Left Behind Act by weakening standards and accountability. Yet the results we require are really a matter of common sense: We expect third graders to read and do math at third grade level - and that is not asking too much. Testing is the only way to identify and help students who are falling behind.\nThis Nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling children along from grade to grade without them learning the basics. I refuse to give up on any child - and the No Child Left Behind Act is opening the door of opportunity to all of America's children.\nAt the same time, we must ensure that older students and adults can gain the skills they need to find work now. Many of the fastest-growing occupations require strong math and science preparation, and training beyond the high school level. So tonight I propose a series of measures called Jobs for the 21st Century. This program will provide extra help to middle- and high school students who fall behind in reading and math, expand Advanced Placement programs in low-income schools, and invite math and science professionals from the private sector to teach part-time in our high schools. I propose larger Pell Grants for students who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school. I propose increasing our support for America's fine community colleges, so they can train workers for the industries that are creating the most new jobs. By all these actions, we will help more and more Americans to join in the growing prosperity of our country.\nJob training is important, and so is job creation. We must continue to pursue an aggressive, pro-growth economic agenda.\nCongress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes. The tax reductions you passed are set to expire. Unless you act, the unfair tax on marriage will go back up. Unless you act, millions of families will be charged 300 dollars more in Federal taxes for every child. Unless you act, small businesses will pay higher taxes. Unless you act, the death tax will eventually come back to life. Unless you act, Americans face a tax increase. What the Congress has given, the Congress should not take away: For the sake of job growth, the tax cuts you passed should be permanent.\nOur agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and employees with relief from needless Federal regulation, and protect them from junk and frivolous lawsuits. Consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run - so I urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system, promote conservation, and make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy. My Administration is promoting free and fair trade, to open up new markets for America's entrepreneurs, and manufacturers, and farmers, and to create jobs for America's workers. Younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their Social Security taxes in a personal retirement account. We should make the Social Security system a source of ownership for the American people.\nAnd we should limit the burden of government on this economy by acting as good stewards of taxpayer dollars. In two weeks, I will send you a budget that funds the war, protects the homeland, and meets important domestic needs, while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than four percent. This will require that Congress focus on priorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the people's money. By doing so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years.\nTonight I also ask you to reform our immigration laws, so they reflect our values and benefit our economy. I propose a new temporary worker program to match willing foreign workers with willing employers, when no Americans can be found to fill the job. This reform will be good for our economy - because employers will find needed workers in an honest and orderly system. A temporary worker program will help protect our homeland - allowing border patrol and law enforcement to focus on true threats to our national security. I oppose amnesty, because it would encourage further illegal immigration, and unfairly reward those who break our laws. My temporary worker program will preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law, while bringing millions of hardworking men and women out from the shadows of American life.\nOur Nation's health care system, like our economy, is also in a time of change. Amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives. This dramatic progress has brought its own challenge, in the rising costs of medical care and health insurance. Members of Congress, we must work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our country.\nMeeting these goals requires bipartisan effort - and two months ago, you showed the way. By strengthening Medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit, you kept a basic commitment to our seniors: You are giving them the modern medicine they deserve.\nStarting this year, under the law you passed, seniors can choose to receive a drug discount card, saving them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most prescription drugs - and millions of low-income seniors can get an additional 600 dollars to buy medicine. Beginning next year, seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease, and seniors just entering Medicare can receive wellness exams.\nIn January of 2006, seniors can get prescription drug coverage under Medicare. For a monthly premium of about 35 dollars, most seniors who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half. Under this reform, senior citizens will be able to keep their Medicare just as it is, or they can choose a Medicare plan that fits them best - just as you, as Members of Congress, can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs. And starting this year, millions of Americans will be able to save money tax-free for their medical expenses, in a health savings account.\nI signed this measure proudly, and any attempt to limit the choices of our seniors, or to take away their prescription drug coverage under Medicare, will meet my veto.\nOn the critical issue of health care, our goal is to ensure that Americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individual needs. To make insurance more affordable, Congress must act to address rapidly rising health care costs. Small businesses should be able to band together and negotiate for lower insurance rates, so they can cover more workers with health insurance - I urge you to pass Association Health Plans. I ask you to give lower-income Americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy their own basic health insurance. By computerizing health records, we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce costs, and improve care. To protect the doctor-patient relationship, and keep good doctors doing good work, we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuits. And tonight I propose that individuals who buy catastrophic health care coverage, as part of our new health savings accounts, be allowed to deduct 100 percent of the premiums from their taxes.\nA government-run health care system is the wrong prescription. By keeping costs under control, expanding access, and helping more Americans afford coverage, we will preserve the system of private medicine that makes America's health care the best in the world.\nWe are living in a time of great change - in our world, in our economy, and in science and medicine. Yet some things endure - courage and compassion, reverence and integrity, respect for differences of faith and race. The values we try to live by never change. And they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions, such as families, and schools, and religious congregations. These institutions - the unseen pillars of civilization - must remain strong in America, and we will defend them.\nWe must stand with our families to help them raise healthy, responsible children. And when it comes to helping children make right choices, there is work for all of us to do.\nOne of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their lives and futures on drugs. Our government is helping parents confront this problem, with aggressive education, treatment, and law enforcement. Drug use in high school has declined by 11 percent over the past two years. Four hundred thousand fewer young people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001. In my budget, I have proposed new funding to continue our aggressive, community-based strategy to reduce demand for illegal drugs. Drug testing in our schools has proven to be an effective part of this effort. So tonight I propose an additional 23 million dollars for schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save children's lives. The aim here is not to punish children, but to send them this message: We love you, and we don't want to lose you.\nTo help children make right choices, they need good examples. Athletics play such an important role in our society, but, unfortunately, some in professional sports are not setting much of an example. The use of performance-enhancing drugs like steroids in baseball, football, and other sports is dangerous, and it sends the wrong message - that there are shortcuts to accomplishment, and that performance is more important than character. So tonight I call on team owners, union representatives, coaches, and players to take the lead, to send the right signal, to get tough, and to get rid of steroids now.\nTo encourage right choices, we must be willing to confront the dangers young people face - even when they are difficult to talk about. Each year, about three million teenagers contract sexually transmitted diseases that can harm them, or kill them, or prevent them from ever becoming parents. In my budget, I propose a grassroots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks. We will double Federal funding for abstinence programs, so schools can teach this fact of life: Abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Decisions children make now can affect their health and character for the rest of their lives. All of us - parents, schools, government - must work together to counter the negative influence of the culture, and to send the right messages to our children.\nA strong America must also value the institution of marriage. I believe we should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization. Congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense of Marriage Act, signed in 1996 by President Clinton. That statute protects marriage under Federal law as the union of a man and a woman, and declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states. Activist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives. On an issue of such great consequence, the people's voice must be heard. If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process. Our Nation must defend the sanctity of marriage.\nThe outcome of this debate is important - and so is the way we conduct it. The same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual has dignity and value in God's sight.\nIt is also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the compassion of America's religious institutions. Religious charities of every creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country - mentoring children, feeding the hungry, taking the hand of the lonely. Yet government has often denied social service grants and contracts to these groups, just because they have a cross or Star of David or crescent on the wall. By Executive Order, I have opened billions of dollars in grant money to competition that includes faith-based charities. Tonight I ask you to codify this into law, so people of faith can know that the law will never discriminate against them again.\nIn the past, we have worked together to bring mentors to the children of prisoners, and provide treatment for the addicted, and help for the homeless. Tonight I ask you to consider another group of Americans in need of help. This year, some 600,000 inmates will be released from prison back into society. We know from long experience that if they can't find work, or a home, or help, they are much more likely to commit more crimes and return to prison. So tonight, I propose a four-year, 300 million dollar Prisoner Re-Entry Initiative to expand job training and placement services, to provide transitional housing, and to help newly released prisoners get mentoring, including from faith-based groups. America is the land of the second chance - and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.\nFor all Americans, the last three years have brought tests we did not ask for, and achievements shared by all. By our actions, we have shown what kind of Nation we are. In grief, we found the grace to go on. In challenge, we rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people. In victory, we have shown the noble aims and good heart of America. And having come this far, we sense that we live in a time set apart.\nI have been a witness to the character of the American people, who have shown calm in times of danger, compassion for one another, and toughness for the long haul. All of us have been partners in a great enterprise. And even some of the youngest understand that we are living in historic times. Last month a girl in Lincoln, Rhode Island, sent me a letter. It began, \"Dear George W. Bush.\" \"If there is anything you know, I Ashley Pearson age 10 can do to help anyone, please send me a letter and tell me what I can do to save our country.\" She added this P.S.: \"If you can send a letter to the troops ... please put, 'Ashley Pearson believes in you.'\" Tonight, Ashley, your message to our troops has just been conveyed. And yes, you have some duties yourself. Study hard in school, listen to your mom and dad, help someone in need, and when you and your friends see a man or woman in uniform, say \"thank you.\" And while you do your part, all of us here in this great chamber will do our best to keep you and the rest of America safe and free.\nMy fellow citizens, we now move forward, with confidence and faith. Our Nation is strong and steadfast. The cause we serve is right, because it is the cause of all mankind. The momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable - and it is not carried forward by our power alone. We can trust in that greater power Who guides the unfolding of the years. And in all that is to come, we can know that His purposes are just and true.\nMay God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\n","Article 2101: General Exceptions\n1.

The windstorm is often referred to as a twister, whirlwind or cyclone, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology to name a weather system with a low-pressure area in the center around which, from an observer looking down toward the surface of the earth, winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, and they are often visible in the form of a condensation funnel originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, with a cloud of rotating debris and dust beneath it. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 mph, are about 250 ft across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph, are more than 2 mi in diameter, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km).\n\nVarious types of tornadoes include the multiple vortex tornado, landspout, and waterspout. Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirl, and steam devil.\n\nTornadoes occur most frequently in North America, particularly in central and southeastern regions of the United States colloquially known as tornado alley, as well as in Southern Africa, northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh and adjacent eastern India, and southeastern South America. Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as hook echoes or debris balls, as well as through the efforts of storm spotters.\n\nThere are several scales for rating the strength of tornadoes. The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale. An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (trochoidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word tornado comes from the Spanish word tornado (past participle of to turn, or to have torn). Tornadoes' opposite phenomena are the derechoes (, from derecho, \"straight\"). A tornado is also commonly referred to as a \"twister\", and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term cyclone. The term \"cyclone\" is used as a synonym for \"tornado\" in the often-aired 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. The term \"twister\" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 tornado-related film Twister.\n\nA tornado is \"a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud\". For a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. Tornado refers to the vortex of wind, not the condensation cloud.\n\nA tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor in the air to condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.\n\nThere is some disagreement over the definition of a funnel cloud and a condensation funnel. According to the Glossary of Meteorology, a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud.\n\nTornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, and not all funnel clouds evolve into tornadoes. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance.\n\nOccasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm cell are referred to as a \"tornado family\". Several tornadoes are sometimes spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a tornado outbreak (although the term \"tornado outbreak\" has various definitions). A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a tornado outbreak sequence, occasionally called an extended tornado outbreak.\n\n\n\nMost tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow funnel, a few hundred yards (meters) across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground. Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. Tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.\n\nSmall, relatively weak landspouts may be visible only as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph, the circulation is considered a tornado. A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a \"stovepipe\" tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large wedges stuck into the ground, and so are known as \"wedge tornadoes\" or \"wedges\". The \"stovepipe\" classification is also used for this type of tornado if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges.\n\nTornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be \"roping out\", or becoming a \"rope tornado\". When they rope out, the length of their funnel increases, which forces the winds within the funnel to weaken due to conservation of angular momentum. Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or they may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel.\n\nIn the United States, tornadoes are around 500 ft across on average and travel on the ground for 5 mi. However, there is a wide range of tornado sizes. Weak tornadoes, or strong yet dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet or couple meters across. One tornado was reported to have a damage path only 7 ft long. On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska on May 22, 2004, was up to 2.5 mi wide at the ground, and a tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma on May 31, 2013 was approximately 2.6 mi wide, the widest on record.\n\nIn terms of path length, the Tri-State Tornado, which affected parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925, was on the ground continuously for 219 mi. Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 mi or longer are composed of a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado may have begun 15 mi further west than previously thought.\n\nTornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.\n\n\n\nLighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is \"back-lit\" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink.\n\nDust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.\n\nThere is mounting evidence, including Doppler on Wheels mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the eye of tropical cyclones. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado.\n\nTornadoes normally rotate cyclonically (when viewed from above, this is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the Coriolis effect, thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is unimportant, as indicated by their large Rossby numbers. Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. Low-level mesocyclones and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment.\n\nApproximately 1 percent of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction in the northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.\n\nTornadoes emit widely on the acoustics spectrum and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby jet engine, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature of and the propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.\n\nThe winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent turbulent eddies, as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable bees or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of \"noise\".\n\nSince many tornadoes are audible only when very near, sound is not to be thought of as a reliable warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.\n\nTornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible infrasonic signatures.\n\nUnlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. Tornadoes also produce a detectable seismic signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process.\n\nTornadoes emit on the electromagnetic spectrum, with sferics and E-field effects detected. There are observed correlations between tornadoes and patterns of lightning. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. Electromagnetics and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a thermodynamic phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.\n\nLuminosity has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and power flashes from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded. In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as temperature, moisture, and pressure. For example, on June 24, 2003 near Manchester, South Dakota, a probe measured a 100 mbar (hPa) (2.95 inHg) pressure decrease. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850 mbar (hPa) (25.10 inHg) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado.\n\n\n\nTornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as supercells. Supercells contain mesocyclones, an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 1 – across. Most intense tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.\n\nMost tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.\n\nAs the mesocyclone lowers below the cloud base, it begins to take in cool, moist air from the downdraft region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an area of low pressure at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, in the form of a visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.\n\nInitially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist air flowing inward to power it, and it grows until it reaches the \"mature stage\". This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. The low pressured atmosphere at the base of the tornado is essential to the endurance of the system. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado.\n\nAs the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the \"dissipating stage\", often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado ends. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. Even though the tornado is dissipating, it is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, due to conservation of angular momentum, winds can increase at this point.\n\nAs the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. Sometimes, in intense supercells, tornadoes can develop cyclically. As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm and possibly feed a new mesocyclone. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old (occluded) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.\n\nAlthough this is a widely accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.\n\n\n\n\n\nA multiple-vortex tornado is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate about their own axis and at the same time around a common center. A multi-vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. This is a phenomenon that is distinct from a satellite tornado, which is a smaller tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to \"orbit\" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct circulation, and is much smaller than the main funnel.\n\n\n\nA waterspout is defined by the National Weather Service as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish \"fair weather\" waterspouts from tornadic (i.e. associated with a mesocyclone) waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar to dust devils and landspouts. They form at the bases of cumulus congestus clouds over tropical and subtropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth laminar walls, and typically travel very slowly. They occur most commonly in the Florida Keys and in the northern Adriatic Sea. In contrast, tornadic waterspouts are stronger tornadoes over water. They form over water similarly to mesocyclonic tornadoes, or are stronger tornadoes which cross over water. Since they form from severe thunderstorms and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are more dangerous. In official tornado statistics, waterspouts are generally not counted unless they affect land, though some European weather agencies count waterspouts and tornadoes together.\n\nA landspout, or dust-tube tornado, is a tornado not associated with a mesocyclone. The name stems from their characterization as a \"fair weather waterspout on land\". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the surface. Landspouts also create a distinctively laminar cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they can produce strong winds which could cause serious damage.\n\n\n\nA gustnado, or gust front tornado, is a small, vertical swirl associated with a gust front or downburst. Because they are not connected with a cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a thunderstorm is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a \"rolling\" effect (often exemplified through a roll cloud). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned vertically or diagonally and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage.\n\n\n\nA dust devil (also known as a whirlwind) resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.\n\nSmall-scale, tornado-like circulations can occur near any intense surface heat source. Those that occur near intense wildfires are called fire whirls. They are not considered tornadoes, except in the rare case where they connect to a pyrocumulus or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage.\n\nA steam devil is a rotating updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations do not involve high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.\n\nThe Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale was an update to the older Fujita scale, by expert elicitation, using engineered wind estimates and better damage descriptions. The EF Scale was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating, and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler weather radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.\n\n\n\nTornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger. In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from subvortices.\n\nIn the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strength—less than 1% are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger). Outside Tornado Alley, and North America in general, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe United States has the most tornadoes of any country, nearly four times more than estimated in all of Europe, excluding waterspouts. This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a large continent that extends from the tropics north into arctic areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the middle latitudes, where most tornadoes of the world occur, the Rocky Mountains block moisture and buckle the atmospheric flow, forcing drier air at mid-levels of the troposphere due to downsloped winds, and causing the formation of a low pressure area downwind to the east of the mountains. Increased westerly flow off the Rockies force the formation of a dry line when the flow aloft is strong, while the Gulf of Mexico fuels abundant low-level moisture in the southerly flow to its east. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States known as Tornado Alley. This area extends into Canada, particularly Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, although southeast Quebec, the interior of British Columbia, and western New Brunswick are also tornado-prone. Tornadoes also occur across northeastern Mexico.\n\nThe United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year, followed by Canada, averaging 62 reported per year. NOAA's has a higher average 100 per year in Canada. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.0013 per sq mi (0.00048 per km 2 ), annually), followed by the UK (around 33, or 0.00035 per sq mi (0.00013 per km 2 ), per year), although those are of lower intensity, briefer and cause minor damage.\n\nTornadoes kill an average of 179 people per year in Bangladesh, the most in the world. Reasons for this include the region's high population density, poor construction quality, and lack of tornado safety knowledge. Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, the La Plata Basin area, portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia.\n\nTornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter, but tornadoes can occur any time of year that favorable conditions occur. Spring and fall experience peaks of activity as those are the seasons when stronger winds, wind shear, and atmospheric instability are present. Tornadoes are focused in the right front quadrant of landfalling tropical cyclones, which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices, which persist until landfall.\n\nTornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of solar heating. Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. Destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The Gainesville Tornado of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time.\n\nThe United Kingdom has the highest incidence of tornadoes, measured by unit area of land, than any other country in the world. Unsettled conditions and weather fronts transverse the Islands at all times of the years and are responsible for spawning the tornadoes, which consequently form at all times of the year. The United Kingdom has at least 34 tornadoes per year and possibly as many as 50, more than any other country in the world relative to its land area. Most tornadoes in the United Kingdom are weak, but they are occasionally destructive. For example, the Birmingham tornado of 2005 and the London tornado of 2006 both registered F2 on the Fujita scale and both caused significant damage and injury.\n\nAssociations with various climate and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the sea surface temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season.\n\nSome evidence does suggest that the Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity, which vary by season and region, as well as whether the ENSO phase is that of El Niño or La Niña. Research has found that fewer tornadoes and hailstorms occur in winter and spring in the U.S. central and southern plains during El Niño, and more occur during La Niña, than in years when temperatures in the Pacific are relatively stable. Ocean conditions could be used to forecast extreme spring storm events several months in advance.\n\nClimatic shifts may affect tornadoes via teleconnections in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable to suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.\n\n\n\nRigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, with the advent of weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks came about in 1952. In 1953, it was confirmed that hook echoes were associated with tornadoes. By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from several miles away.\n\nToday, most developed countries have a network of weather radars, which serves as the primary method of detecting hook signatures that are likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries, Doppler weather radar stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial direction (towards or away from the radar) of the winds within a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from over 100 mi away. When storms are distant from a radar, only areas high within the storm are observed and the important areas below are not sampled. Data resolution also decreases with distance from the radar. Some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and tornado development may occasionally take place more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data. Doppler radar systems can detect mesocyclones within a supercell thunderstorm. This allows meteorologists to predict tornado formations throughout thunderstorms.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train storm spotters so they could spot key features of storms that indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as storm damage and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request these spotters to look out for severe weather and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.\n\nSpotters usually are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as sirens and the Emergency Alert System (EAS), and they forward the report to the NWS. There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States.\n\nIn Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called Canwarn, helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe and the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since 1974.\n\nStorm spotters are required because radar systems such as NEXRAD do not really detect tornadoes; merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or an imminent one, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar can't is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.\n\nStorm spotters are trained to discern whether or not a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under that updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is the formation of a rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.\n\nEvidence of a supercell is based on the storm's shape and structure, and cloud tower features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large overshooting top, a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level winds), and a corkscrew look or striations. Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and the likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a \"beaver tail\", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and rear flank downdraft, and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow.\n\nOnly wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and they usually precede the tornado between five and thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds may be a visual manifestation of a low-level mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly afterwards; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also develop without wall clouds, under flanking lines and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.\n\nThe most record-breaking tornado in recorded history was the Tri-State Tornado, which roared through parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925. It was likely an F5, though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 mi), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph) anywhere on Earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). The tornado was also the costliest tornado in history at the time (unadjusted for inflation), but in the years since has been surpassed by several others if population changes over time are not considered. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it ranks third today.\n\nThe deadliest tornado in world history was the Daultipur-Salturia Tornado in Bangladesh on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1,300 people. Bangladesh has had at least 19 tornadoes in its history kill more than 100 people, almost half of the total in the rest of the world.\n\nThe most extensive tornado outbreak on record was the 2011 Super Outbreak, which spawned 360 confirmed tornadoes over the southeastern United States – 216 of them within a single 24-hour period. The previous record was the 1974 Super Outbreak which spawned 148 tornadoes.\n\nWhile direct measurement of the most violent tornado wind speeds is nearly impossible, since conventional anemometers would be destroyed by the intense winds and flying debris, some tornadoes have been scanned by mobile Doppler radar units, which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301 ± 20 mph (484 ± 32 km/h) in the F5 Bridge Creek-Moore, Oklahoma, tornado which killed 36 people. Though the reading was taken about 100 ft above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes.\n\nStorms that produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mi/h. Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected Great Bend, Kansas, in November 1915, was an extreme case, where a \"rain of debris\" occurred 80 mi from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 mi away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of Palmyra, Nebraska, 305 mi to the northeast. Waterspouts and tornadoes have been advanced as an explanation for instances of raining fish and other animals.\n\nThough tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.\n\nSome countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as tornado watches and warnings in the United States and Canada). Weather radios provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.\n\nFolklore often identifies a green sky with tornadoes, and though the phenomenon may be associated with severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. Another commonly held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 tornado outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew and several other people take shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike and safely ride out a tornado as it passes by. However, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado, and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Due to the Venturi effect, tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass. Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at each of the three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.\n\nAn old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.\n\nThere are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by being in a city, near a major river, hill, or mountain, or even protected by supernatural forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, affect valleys, and have damaged several city centers. As a general rule, no area is safe from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others.\n\nMeteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes is newer still. Although researched for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. Scientists have a fairly good understanding of the development of thunderstorms and mesocyclones, and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation. However, the step from supercell, or other respective formative processes, to tornadogenesis and the prediction of tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well known and is the focus of much research.\n\nAlso under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level vorticity which tightens into a tornado, in particular, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone.\n\nIn particular, the role of downdrafts, particularly the rear-flank downdraft, and the role of baroclinic boundaries, are intense areas of study.\n\nReliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with mesovortices within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones.\n\nScientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.\n\nResearch programs, including field projects such as the VORTEX projects (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment), deployment of TOTO (the TOtable Tornado Observatory), Doppler on Wheels (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. Universities, government agencies such as the National Severe Storms Laboratory, private-sector meteorologists, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the National Science Foundation. The pace of research is partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken; gaps in information about the wind, pressure, and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere; and the computing power available for simulation.\n\nSolar storms similar to tornadoes have been recorded, but it is unknown how closely related they are to their terrestrial counterparts.\n\n\n"]
