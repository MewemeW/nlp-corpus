["'I shall never forget Tony's face.  'Twas a little, round, firm, tight\nface, with a seam here and there left by the smallpox, but not enough to\nhurt his looks in a woman's eye, though he'd had it badish when he was a\nboy.  So very serious looking and unsmiling 'a was, that young man, that\nit really seemed as if he couldn't laugh at all without great pain to his\nconscience.  He looked very hard at a small speck in your eye when\ntalking to 'ee.  And there was no more sign of a whisker or beard on Tony\nKytes's face than on the palm of my hand.  He used to sing \"The Tailor's\nBreeches\" with a religious manner, as if it were a hymn:--\n\n'\"O the petticoats went off, and the breeches they went on!\"\n\nand all the rest of the scandalous stuff.  He was quite the women's\nfavourite, and in return for their likings he loved 'em in shoals.\n\n'But in course of time Tony got fixed down to one in particular, Milly\nRichards, a nice, light, small, tender little thing; and it was soon said\nthat they were engaged to be married.  One Saturday he had been to market\nto do business for his father, and was driving home the waggon in the\nafternoon.  When he reached the foot of the very hill we shall be going\nover in ten minutes who should he see waiting for him at the top but\nUnity Sallet, a handsome girl, one of the young women he'd been very\ntender toward before he'd got engaged to Milly.\n\n'As soon as Tony came up to her she said, \"My dear Tony, will you give me\na lift home?\"\n\n'\"That I will, darling,\" said Tony.  \"You don't suppose I could refuse\n'ee?\"\n\n'She smiled a smile, and up she hopped, and on drove Tony.\n\n'\"Tony,\" she says, in a sort of tender chide, \"why did ye desert me for\nthat other one?  In what is she better than I?  I should have made 'ee a\nfiner wife, and a more loving one too.  'Tisn't girls that are so easily\nwon at first that are the best.  Think how long we've known each\nother--ever since we were children almost--now haven't we, Tony?\"\n\n'\"Yes, that we have,\" says Tony, a-struck with the truth o't.\n\n'\"And you've never seen anything in me to complain of, have ye, Tony?  Now\ntell the truth to me?\"\n\n'\"I never have, upon my life,\" says Tony.\n\n'\"And--can you say I'm not pretty, Tony?  Now look at me!\"\n\n'He let his eyes light upon her for a long while.  \"I really can't,\" says\nhe.  \"In fact, I never knowed you was so pretty before!\"\n\n'\"Prettier than she?\"\n\n'What Tony would have said to that nobody knows, for before he could\nspeak, what should he see ahead, over the hedge past the turning, but a\nfeather he knew well--the feather in Milly's hat--she to whom he had been\nthinking of putting the question as to giving out the banns that very\nweek.\n\n'\"Unity,\" says he, as mild as he could, \"here's Milly coming.  Now I\nshall catch it mightily if she sees 'ee riding here with me; and if you\nget down she'll be turning the corner in a moment, and, seeing 'ee in the\nroad, she'll know we've been coming on together.  Now, dearest Unity,\nwill ye, to avoid all unpleasantness, which I know ye can't bear any more\nthan I, will ye lie down in the back part of the waggon, and let me cover\nyou over with the tarpaulin till Milly has passed?  It will all be done\nin a minute.  Do!--and I'll think over what we've said; and perhaps I\nshall put a loving question to you after all, instead of to Milly.\n'Tisn't true that it is all settled between her and me.\"\n\n'Well, Unity Sallet agreed, and lay down at the back end of the waggon,\nand Tony covered her over, so that the waggon seemed to be empty but for\nthe loose tarpaulin; and then he drove on to meet Milly.\n\n'\"My dear Tony!\" cries Milly, looking up with a little pout at him as he\ncame near.  \"How long you've been coming home!  Just as if I didn't live\nat Upper Longpuddle at all!  And I've come to meet you as you asked me to\ndo, and to ride back with you, and talk over our future home--since you\nasked me, and I promised.  But I shouldn't have come else, Mr. Tony!\"\n\n'\"Ay, my dear, I did ask ye--to be sure I did, now I think of it--but I\nhad quite forgot it.  To ride back with me, did you say, dear Milly?\"\n\n'\"Well, of course!  What can I do else?  Surely you don't want me to\nwalk, now I've come all this way?\"\n\n'\"O no, no!  I was thinking you might be going on to town to meet your\nmother.  I saw her there--and she looked as if she might be expecting\n'ee.\"\n\n'\"O no; she's just home.  She came across the fields, and so got back\nbefore you.\"\n\n'\"Ah!  I didn't know that,\" says Tony.  And there was no help for it but\nto take her up beside him.\n\n'They talked on very pleasantly, and looked at the trees, and beasts, and\nbirds, and insects, and at the ploughmen at work in the fields, till\npresently who should they see looking out of the upper window of a house\nthat stood beside the road they were following, but Hannah Jolliver,\nanother young beauty of the place at that time, and the very first woman\nthat Tony had fallen in love with--before Milly and before Unity, in\nfact--the one that he had almost arranged to marry instead of Milly.  She\nwas a much more dashing girl than Milly Richards, though he'd not thought\nmuch of her of late.  The house Hannah was looking from was her aunt's.\n\n'\"My dear Milly--my coming wife, as I may call 'ee,\" says Tony in his\nmodest way, and not so loud that Unity could overhear, \"I see a young\nwoman alooking out of window, who I think may accost me.  The fact is,\nMilly, she had a notion that I was wishing to marry her, and since she's\ndiscovered I've promised another, and a prettier than she, I'm rather\nafeard of her temper if she sees us together.  Now, Milly, would you do\nme a favour--my coming wife, as I may say?\"\n\n'\"Certainly, dearest Tony,\" says she.\n\n'\"Then would ye creep under the empty sacks just here in the front of the\nwaggon, and hide there out of sight till we've passed the house?  She\nhasn't seen us yet.  You see, we ought to live in peace and good-will\nsince 'tis almost Christmas, and 'twill prevent angry passions rising,\nwhich we always should do.\"\n\n'\"I don't mind, to oblige you, Tony,\" Milly said; and though she didn't\ncare much about doing it, she crept under, and crouched down just behind\nthe seat, Unity being snug at the other end.  So they drove on till they\ngot near the road-side cottage.  Hannah had soon seen him coming, and\nwaited at the window, looking down upon him.  She tossed her head a\nlittle disdainful and smiled off-hand.\n\n'\"Well, aren't you going to be civil enough to ask me to ride home with\nyou!\" she says, seeing that he was for driving past with a nod and a\nsmile.\n\n'\"Ah, to be sure!  What was I thinking of?\" said Tony, in a flutter.  \"But\nyou seem as if you was staying at your aunt's?\"\n\n'\"No, I am not,\" she said.  \"Don't you see I have my bonnet and jacket\non?  I have only called to see her on my way home.  How can you be so\nstupid, Tony?\"\n\n'\"In that case--ah--of course you must come along wi' me,\" says Tony,\nfeeling a dim sort of sweat rising up inside his clothes.  And he reined\nin the horse, and waited till she'd come downstairs, and then helped her\nup beside him.  He drove on again, his face as long as a face that was a\nround one by nature well could be.\n\n'Hannah looked round sideways into his eyes.  \"This is nice, isn't it,\nTony?\" she says.  \"I like riding with you.\"\n\n'Tony looked back into her eyes.  \"And I with you,\" he said after a\nwhile.  In short, having considered her, he warmed up, and the more he\nlooked at her the more he liked her, till he couldn't for the life of him\nthink why he had ever said a word about marriage to Milly or Unity while\nHannah Jolliver was in question.  So they sat a little closer and closer,\ntheir feet upon the foot-board and their shoulders touching, and Tony\nthought over and over again how handsome Hannah was.  He spoke tenderer\nand tenderer, and called her \"dear Hannah\" in a whisper at last.\n\n'\"You've settled it with Milly by this time, I suppose,\" said she.\n\n'\"N-no, not exactly.\"\n\n'\"What?  How low you talk, Tony.\"\n\n'\"Yes--I've a kind of hoarseness.  I said, not exactly.\"\n\n'\"I suppose you mean to?\"\n\n'\"Well, as to that--\"  His eyes rested on her face, and hers on his.  He\nwondered how he could have been such a fool as not to follow up Hannah.\n\"My sweet Hannah!\" he bursts out, taking her hand, not being really able\nto help it, and forgetting Milly and Unity, and all the world besides.\n\"Settled it?  I don't think I have!\"\n\n'\"Hark!\" says Hannah.\n\n'\"What?\" says Tony, letting go her hand.\n\n'\"Surely I heard a sort of little screaming squeak under those sacks?\nWhy, you've been carrying corn, and there's mice in this waggon, I\ndeclare!\"  She began to haul up the tails of her gown.\n\n'\"Oh no; 'tis the axle,\" said Tony in an assuring way.  \"It do go like\nthat sometimes in dry weather.\"\n\n'\"Perhaps it was . . . Well, now, to be quite honest, dear Tony, do you\nlike her better than me?  Because--because, although I've held off so\nindependent, I'll own at last that I do like 'ee, Tony, to tell the\ntruth; and I wouldn't say no if you asked me--you know what.\"\n\n'Tony was so won over by this pretty offering mood of a girl who had been\nquite the reverse (Hannah had a backward way with her at times, if you\ncan mind) that he just glanced behind, and then whispered very soft, \"I\nhaven't quite promised her, and I think I can get out of it, and ask you\nthat question you speak of.\"\n\n'\"Throw over Milly?--all to marry me!  How delightful!\" broke out Hannah,\nquite loud, clapping her hands.\n\n'At this there was a real squeak--an angry, spiteful squeak, and\nafterward a long moan, as if something had broke its heart, and a\nmovement of the empty sacks.\n\n'\"Something's there!\" said Hannah, starting up.\n\n'\"It's nothing, really,\" says Tony in a soothing voice, and praying\ninwardly for a way out of this.  \"I wouldn't tell 'ee at first, because I\nwouldn't frighten 'ee.  But, Hannah, I've really a couple of ferrets in a\nbag under there, for rabbiting, and they quarrel sometimes.  I don't wish\nit knowed, as 'twould be called poaching.  Oh, they can't get out, bless\nye--you are quite safe!  And--and--what a fine day it is, isn't it,\nHannah, for this time of year?  Be you going to market next Saturday?  How\nis your aunt now?\"  And so on, says Tony, to keep her from talking any\nmore about love in Milly's hearing.\n\n'But he found his work cut out for him, and wondering again how he should\nget out of this ticklish business, he looked about for a chance.  Nearing\nhome he saw his father in a field not far off, holding up his hand as if\nhe wished to speak to Tony.\n\n'\"Would you mind taking the reins a moment, Hannah,\" he said, much\nrelieved, \"while I go and find out what father wants?\"\n\n'She consented, and away he hastened into the field, only too glad to get\nbreathing time.  He found that his father was looking at him with rather\na stern eye.\n\n'\"Come, come, Tony,\" says old Mr. Kytes, as soon as his son was alongside\nhim, \"this won't do, you know.\"\n\n'\"What?\" says Tony.\n\n'\"Why, if you mean to marry Milly Richards, do it, and there's an end\no't.  But don't go driving about the country with Jolliver's daughter and\nmaking a scandal.  I won't have such things done.\"\n\n'\"I only asked her--that is, she asked me, to ride home.\"\n\n'\"She?  Why, now, if it had been Milly, 'twould have been quite proper;\nbut you and Hannah Jolliver going about by yourselves--\"\n\n'\"Milly's there too, father.\"\n\n'\"Milly?  Where?\"\n\n'\"Under the corn-sacks!  Yes, the truth is, father, I've got rather into\na nunny-watch, I'm afeard!  Unity Sallet is there too--yes, at the other\nend, under the tarpaulin.  All three are in that waggon, and what to do\nwith 'em I know no more than the dead!  The best plan is, as I'm\nthinking, to speak out loud and plain to one of 'em before the rest, and\nthat will settle it; not but what 'twill cause 'em to kick up a bit of a\nmiff, for certain.  Now which would you marry, father, if you was in my\nplace?\"\n\n'\"Whichever of 'em did _not_ ask to ride with thee.\"\n\n'\"That was Milly, I'm bound to say, as she only mounted by my invitation.\nBut Milly--\"\n\n\"Then stick to Milly, she's the best . . . But look at that!\"\n\n'His father pointed toward the waggon.  \"She can't hold that horse in.\nYou shouldn't have left the reins in her hands.  Run on and take the\nhorse's head, or there'll be some accident to them maids!\"\n\n'Tony's horse, in fact, in spite of Hannah's tugging at the reins, had\nstarted on his way at a brisk walking pace, being very anxious to get\nback to the stable, for he had had a long day out.  Without another word\nTony rushed away from his father to overtake the horse.\n\n'Now of all things that could have happened to wean him from Milly there\nwas nothing so powerful as his father's recommending her.  No; it could\nnot be Milly, after all.  Hannah must be the one, since he could not\nmarry all three.  This he thought while running after the waggon.  But\nqueer things were happening inside it.\n\n'It was, of course, Milly who had screamed under the sack-bags, being\nobliged to let off her bitter rage and shame in that way at what Tony was\nsaying, and never daring to show, for very pride and dread o' being\nlaughed at, that she was in hiding.  She became more and more restless,\nand in twisting herself about, what did she see but another woman's foot\nand white stocking close to her head.  It quite frightened her, not\nknowing that Unity Sallet was in the waggon likewise.  But after the\nfright was over she determined to get to the bottom of all this, and she\ncrept and crept along the bed of the waggon, under the tarpaulin, like a\nsnake, when lo and behold she came face to face with Unity.\n\n'\"Well, if this isn't disgraceful!\" says Milly in a raging whisper to\nUnity.\n\n'\"'Tis,\" says Unity, \"to see you hiding in a young man's waggon like\nthis, and no great character belonging to either of ye!\"\n\n'\"Mind what you are saying!\" replied Milly, getting louder.  \"I am\nengaged to be married to him, and haven't I a right to be here?  What\nright have you, I should like to know?  What has he been promising you?  A\npretty lot of nonsense, I expect!  But what Tony says to other women is\nall mere wind, and no concern to me!\"\n\n'\"Don't you be too sure!\" says Unity.  \"He's going to have Hannah, and\nnot you, nor me either; I could hear that.\"\n\n'Now at these strange voices sounding from under the cloth Hannah was\nthunderstruck a'most into a swound; and it was just at this time that the\nhorse moved on.  Hannah tugged away wildly, not knowing what she was\ndoing; and as the quarrel rose louder and louder Hannah got so horrified\nthat she let go the reins altogether.  The horse went on at his own pace,\nand coming to the corner where we turn round to drop down the hill to\nLower Longpuddle he turned too quick, the off wheels went up the bank,\nthe waggon rose sideways till it was quite on edge upon the near axles,\nand out rolled the three maidens into the road in a heap.\n\n'When Tony came up, frightened and breathless, he was relieved enough to\nsee that neither of his darlings was hurt, beyond a few scratches from\nthe brambles of the hedge.  But he was rather alarmed when he heard how\nthey were going on at one another.\n\n'\"Don't ye quarrel, my dears--don't ye!\" says he, taking off his hat out\nof respect to 'em.  And then he would have kissed them all round, as fair\nand square as a man could, but they were in too much of a taking to let\nhim, and screeched and sobbed till they was quite spent.\n\n'\"Now I'll speak out honest, because I ought to,\" says Tony, as soon as\nhe could get heard.  \"And this is the truth,\" says he.  \"I've asked\nHannah to be mine, and she is willing, and we are going to put up the\nbanns next--\"\n\n'Tony had not noticed that Hannah's father was coming up behind, nor had\nhe noticed that Hannah's face was beginning to bleed from the scratch of\na bramble.  Hannah had seen her father, and had run to him, crying worse\nthan ever.\n\n'\"My daughter is _not_ willing, sir!\" says Mr. Jolliver hot and strong.\n\"Be you willing, Hannah?  I ask ye to have spirit enough to refuse him,\nif yer virtue is left to 'ee and you run no risk?\"\n\n'\"She's as sound as a bell for me, that I'll swear!\" says Tony, flaring\nup.  \"And so's the others, come to that, though you may think it an\nonusual thing in me!\"\n\n'\"I have spirit, and I do refuse him!\" says Hannah, partly because her\nfather was there, and partly, too, in a tantrum because of the discovery,\nand the scratch on her face.  \"Little did I think when I was so soft with\nhim just now that I was talking to such a false deceiver!\"\n\n'\"What, you won't have me, Hannah?\" says Tony, his jaw hanging down like\na dead man's.\n\n'\"Never--I would sooner marry no--nobody at all!\" she gasped out, though\nwith her heart in her throat, for she would not have refused Tony if he\nhad asked her quietly, and her father had not been there, and her face\nhad not been scratched by the bramble.  And having said that, away she\nwalked upon her father's arm, thinking and hoping he would ask her again.\n\n'Tony didn't know what to say next.  Milly was sobbing her heart out; but\nas his father had strongly recommended her he couldn't feel inclined that\nway.  So he turned to Unity.\n\n'\"Well, will you, Unity dear, be mine?\" he says.\n\n'\"Take her leavings?  Not I!\" says Unity.  \"I'd scorn it!\"  And away\nwalks Unity Sallet likewise, though she looked back when she'd gone some\nway, to see if he was following her.\n\n'So there at last were left Milly and Tony by themselves, she crying in\nwatery streams, and Tony looking like a tree struck by lightning.\n\n'\"Well, Milly,\" he says at last, going up to her, \"it do seem as if fate\nhad ordained that it should be you and I, or nobody.  And what must be\nmust be, I suppose.  Hey, Milly?\"\n\n'\"If you like, Tony.  You didn't really mean what you said to them?\"\n\n'\"Not a word of it!\" declares Tony, bringing down his fist upon his palm.\n\n'And then he kissed her, and put the waggon to rights, and they mounted\ntogether; and their banns were put up the very next Sunday.  I was not\nable to go to their wedding, but it was a rare party they had, by all\naccount.  Everybody in Longpuddle was there almost; you among the rest, I\nthink, Mr. Flaxton?'  The speaker turned to the parish clerk.\n\n'I was,' said Mr. Flaxton.  'And that party was the cause of a very\ncurious change in some other people's affairs; I mean in Steve Hardcome's\nand his cousin James's.'\n\n'Ah! the Hardcomes,' said the stranger.  'How familiar that name is to\nme!  What of them?'\n\nThe clerk cleared his throat and began:--\n\n\nTHE HISTORY OF THE HARDCOMES\n\n\n'Yes, Tony's was the very best wedding-randy that ever I was at; and I've\nbeen at a good many, as you may suppose'--turning to the newly-arrived\none--'having as a church-officer, the privilege to attend all\nchristening, wedding, and funeral parties--such being our Wessex custom.\n\n''Twas on a frosty night in Christmas week, and among the folk invited\nwere the said Hardcomes o' Climmerston--Steve and James--first cousins,\nboth of them small farmers, just entering into business on their own\naccount.  With them came, as a matter of course, their intended wives,\ntwo young women of the neighbourhood, both very pretty and sprightly\nmaidens, and numbers of friends from Abbot's-Cernel, and Weatherbury, and\nMellstock, and I don't know where--a regular houseful.\n\n'The kitchen was cleared of furniture for dancing, and the old folk\nplayed at \"Put\" and \"All-fours\" in the parlour, though at last they gave\nthat up to join in the dance.  The top of the figure was by the large\nfront window of the room, and there were so many couples that the lower\npart of the figure reached through the door at the back, and into the\ndarkness of the out-house; in fact, you couldn't see the end of the row\nat all, and 'twas never known exactly how long that dance was, the lowest\ncouples being lost among the faggots and brushwood in the out-house.\n\n'When we had danced a few hours, and the crowns of we taller men were\nswelling into lumps with bumping the beams of the ceiling, the first\nfiddler laid down his fiddle-bow, and said he should play no more, for he\nwished to dance.  And in another hour the second fiddler laid down his,\nand said he wanted to dance too; so there was only the third fiddler\nleft, and he was a' old, veteran man, very weak in the wrist.  However,\nhe managed to keep up a faltering tweedle-dee; but there being no chair\nin the room, and his knees being as weak as his wrists, he was obliged to\nsit upon as much of the little corner-table as projected beyond the\ncorner-cupboard fixed over it, which was not a very wide seat for a man\nadvanced in years.\n\n'Among those who danced most continually were the two engaged couples, as\nwas natural to their situation.  Each pair was very well matched, and\nvery unlike the other.  James Hardcome's intended was called Emily Darth,\nand both she and James were gentle, nice-minded, in-door people, fond of\na quiet life.  Steve and his chosen, named Olive Pawle, were different;\nthey were of a more bustling nature, fond of racketing about and seeing\nwhat was going on in the world.  The two couples had arranged to get\nmarried on the same day, and that not long thence; Tony's wedding being a\nsort of stimulant, as is often the case; I've noticed it professionally\nmany times.\n\n'They danced with such a will as only young people in that stage of\ncourtship can dance; and it happened that as the evening wore on James\nhad for his partner Stephen's plighted one, Olive, at the same time that\nStephen was dancing with James's Emily.  It was noticed that in spite o'\nthe exchange the young men seemed to enjoy the dance no less than before.\nBy and by they were treading another tune in the same changed order as we\nhad noticed earlier, and though at first each one had held the other's\nmistress strictly at half-arm's length, lest there should be shown any\nobjection to too close quarters by the lady's proper man, as time passed\nthere was a little more closeness between 'em; and presently a little\nmore closeness still.\n\n'The later it got the more did each of the two cousins dance with the\nwrong young girl, and the tighter did he hold her to his side as he\nwhirled her round; and, what was very remarkable, neither seemed to mind\nwhat the other was doing.  The party began to draw towards its end, and I\nsaw no more that night, being one of the first to leave, on account of my\nmorning's business.  But I learnt the rest of it from those that knew.\n\n'After finishing a particularly warming dance with the changed partners,\nas I've mentioned, the two young men looked at one another, and in a\nmoment or two went out into the porch together.\n\n'\"James,\" says Steve, \"what were you thinking of when you were dancing\nwith my Olive?\"\n\n'\"Well,\" said James, \"perhaps what you were thinking of when you were\ndancing with my Emily.\"\n\n'\"I was thinking,\" said Steve, with some hesitation, \"that I wouldn't\nmind changing for good and all!\"\n\n'\"It was what I was feeling likewise,\" said James.\n\n'\"I willingly agree to it, if you think we could manage it.\"\n\n'\"So do I.  But what would the girls say?\"\n\n'\"'Tis my belief,\" said Steve, \"that they wouldn't particularly object.\nYour Emily clung as close to me as if she already belonged to me, dear\ngirl.\"\n\n'\"And your Olive to me,\" says James.  \"I could feel her heart beating\nlike a clock.\"\n\n'Well, they agreed to put it to the girls when they were all four walking\nhome together.  And they did so.  When they parted that night the\nexchange was decided on--all having been done under the hot excitement of\nthat evening's dancing.  Thus it happened that on the following Sunday\nmorning, when the people were sitting in church with mouths wide open to\nhear the names published as they had expected, there was no small\namazement to hear them coupled the wrong way, as it seemed.  The\ncongregation whispered, and thought the parson had made a mistake; till\nthey discovered that his reading of the names was verily the true way.  As\nthey had decided, so they were married, each one to the other's original\nproperty.\n\n'Well, the two couples lived on for a year or two ordinarily enough, till\nthe time came when these young people began to grow a little less warm to\ntheir respective spouses, as is the rule of married life; and the two\ncousins wondered more and more in their hearts what had made 'em so mad\nat the last moment to marry crosswise as they did, when they might have\nmarried straight, as was planned by nature, and as they had fallen in\nlove.  'Twas Tony's party that had done _it_, plain enough, and they half\nwished they had never gone there.  James, being a quiet, fireside,\nperusing man, felt at times a wide gap between himself and Olive, his\nwife, who loved riding and driving and out-door jaunts to a degree;\nwhile Steve, who was always knocking about hither and thither, had a very\ndomestic wife, who worked samplers, and made hearthrugs, scarcely ever\nwished to cross the threshold, and only drove out with him to please him.\n\n'However, they said very little about this mismating to any of their\nacquaintances, though sometimes Steve would look at James's wife and\nsigh, and James would look at Steve's wife and do the same.  Indeed, at\nlast the two men were frank enough towards each other not to mind\nmentioning it quietly to themselves, in a long-faced, sorry-smiling,\nwhimsical sort of way, and would shake their heads together over their\nfoolishness in upsetting a well-considered choice on the strength of an\nhour's fancy in the whirl and wildness of a dance.  Still, they were\nsensible and honest young fellows enough, and did their best to make\nshift with their lot as they had arranged it, and not to repine at what\ncould not now be altered or mended.\n\n'So things remained till one fine summer day they went for their yearly\nlittle outing together, as they had made it their custom to do for a long\nwhile past.  This year they chose Budmouth-Regis as the place to spend\ntheir holiday in; and off they went in their best clothes at nine o'clock\nin the morning.\n\n'When they had reached Budmouth-Regis they walked two and two along the\nshore--their new boots going squeakity-squash upon the clammy velvet\nsands.  I can seem to see 'em now!  Then they looked at the ships in the\nharbour; and then went up to the Look-out; and then had dinner at an inn;\nand then again walked two and two, squeakity-squash, upon the velvet\nsands.  As evening drew on they sat on one of the public seats upon the\nEsplanade, and listened to the band; and then they said \"What shall we do\nnext?\"\n\n'\"Of all things,\" said Olive (Mrs. James Hardcome, that is), \"I should\nlike to row in the bay!  We could listen to the music from the water as\nwell as from here, and have the fun of rowing besides.\"\n\n'\"The very thing; so should I,\" says Stephen, his tastes being always\nlike hers.\n\nHere the clerk turned to the curate.\n\n'But you, sir, know the rest of the strange particulars of that strange\nevening of their lives better than anybody else, having had much of it\nfrom their own lips, which I had not; and perhaps you'll oblige the\ngentleman?'\n\n'Certainly, if it is wished,' said the curate.  And he took up the\nclerk's tale:--\n\n* * * * *\n\n'Stephen's wife hated the sea, except from land, and couldn't bear the\nthought of going into a boat.  James, too, disliked the water, and said\nthat for his part he would much sooner stay on and listen to the band in\nthe seat they occupied, though he did not wish to stand in his wife's way\nif she desired a row.  The end of the discussion was that James and his\ncousin's wife Emily agreed to remain where they were sitting and enjoy\nthe music, while they watched the other two hire a boat just beneath, and\ntake their water-excursion of half an hour or so, till they should choose\nto come back and join the sitters on the Esplanade; when they would all\nstart homeward together.\n\n'Nothing could have pleased the other two restless ones better than this\narrangement; and Emily and James watched them go down to the boatman\nbelow and choose one of the little yellow skiffs, and walk carefully out\nupon the little plank that was laid on trestles to enable them to get\nalongside the craft.  They saw Stephen hand Olive in, and take his seat\nfacing her; when they were settled they waved their hands to the couple\nwatching them, and then Stephen took the pair of sculls and pulled off to\nthe tune beat by the band, she steering through the other boats skimming\nabout, for the sea was as smooth as glass that evening, and\npleasure-seekers were rowing everywhere.\n\n'\"How pretty they look moving on, don't they?\" said Emily to James (as\nI've been assured).  \"They both enjoy it equally.  In everything their\nlikings are the same.\"\n\n'\"That's true,\" said James.\n\n'\"They would have made a handsome pair if they had married,\" said she.\n\n'\"Yes,\" said he.  \"'Tis a pity we should have parted 'em\"\n\n'\"Don't talk of that, James,\" said she.  \"For better or for worse we\ndecided to do as we did, and there's an end of it.\"\n\n'They sat on after that without speaking, side by side, and the band\nplayed as before; the people strolled up and down; and Stephen and Olive\nshrank smaller and smaller as they shot straight out to sea.  The two on\nshore used to relate how they saw Stephen stop rowing a moment, and take\noff his coat to get at his work better; but James's wife sat quite still\nin the stern, holding the tiller-ropes by which she steered the boat.\nWhen they had got very small indeed she turned her head to shore.\n\n'\"She is waving her handkerchief to us,\" said Stephen's wife, who\nthereupon pulled out her own, and waved it as a return signal.\n\n'The boat's course had been a little awry while Mrs. James neglected her\nsteering to wave her handkerchief to her husband and Mrs. Stephen; but\nnow the light skiff went straight onward again, and they could soon see\nnothing more of the two figures it contained than Olive's light mantle\nand Stephen's white shirt sleeves behind.\n\n'The two on the shore talked on.  \"'Twas very curious--our changing\npartners at Tony Kytes's wedding,\" Emily declared.  \"Tony was of a fickle\nnature by all account, and it really seemed as if his character had\ninfected us that night.  Which of you two was it that first proposed not\nto marry as we were engaged?\"\n\n'\"H'm--I can't remember at this moment,\" says James.  \"We talked it over,\nyou know; and no sooner said than done.\"\n\n'\"'Twas the dancing,\" said she.  \"People get quite crazy sometimes in a\ndance.\"\n\n'\"They do,\" he owned.\n\n'\"James--do you think they care for one another still?\" asks Mrs.\nStephen.\n\n'James Hardcome mused and admitted that perhaps a little tender feeling\nmight flicker up in their hearts for a moment now and then.  \"Still,\nnothing of any account,\" he said.\n\n'\"I sometimes think that Olive is in Steve's mind a good deal,\" murmurs\nMrs. Stephen; \"particularly when she pleases his fancy by riding past our\nwindow at a gallop on one of the draught-horses . . . I never could do\nanything of that sort; I could never get over my fear of a horse.\"\n\n'\"And I am no horseman, though I pretend to be on her account,\" murmured\nJames Hardcome.  \"But isn't it almost time for them to turn and sweep\nround to the shore, as the other boating folk have done?  I wonder what\nOlive means by steering away straight to the horizon like that?  She has\nhardly swerved from a direct line seaward since they started.\"\n\n'\"No doubt they are talking, and don't think of where they are going,\"\nsuggests Stephen's wife.\n\n'\"Perhaps so,\" said James.  \"I didn't know Steve could row like that.\"\n\n'\"O yes,\" says she.  \"He often comes here on business, and generally has\na pull round the bay.\"\n\n'\"I can hardly see the boat or them,\" says James again; \"and it is\ngetting dark.\"\n\n'The heedless pair afloat now formed a mere speck in the films of the\ncoming night, which thickened apace, till it completely swallowed up\ntheir distant shapes.  They had disappeared while still following the\nsame straight course away from the world of land-livers, as if they were\nintending to drop over the sea-edge into space, and never return to earth\nagain.\n\n'The two on the shore continued to sit on, punctually abiding by their\nagreement to remain on the same spot till the others returned.  The\nEsplanade lamps were lit one by one, the bandsmen folded up their stands\nand departed, the yachts in the bay hung out their riding lights, and the\nlittle boats came back to shore one after another, their hirers walking\non to the sands by the plank they had climbed to go afloat; but among\nthese Stephen and Olive did not appear.\n\n'\"What a time they are!\" said Emily.  \"I am getting quite chilly.  I did\nnot expect to have to sit so long in the evening air.\"\n\n'Thereupon James Hardcome said that he did not require his overcoat, and\ninsisted on lending it to her.\n\n'He wrapped it round Emily's shoulders.\n\n'\"Thank you, James,\" she said.  \"How cold Olive must be in that thin\njacket!\"\n\n'He said he was thinking so too.  \"Well, they are sure to be quite close\nat hand by this time, though we can't see 'em.  The boats are not all in\nyet.  Some of the rowers are fond of paddling along the shore to finish\nout their hour of hiring.\"\n\n'\"Shall we walk by the edge of the water,\" said she, \"to see if we can\ndiscover them?\"\n\n'He assented, reminding her that they must not lose sight of the seat,\nlest the belated pair should return and miss them, and be vexed that they\nhad not kept the appointment.\n\n'They walked a sentry beat up and down the sands immediately opposite the\nseat; and still the others did not come.  James Hardcome at last went to\nthe boatman, thinking that after all his wife and cousin might have come\nin under shadow of the dusk without being perceived, and might have\nforgotten the appointment at the bench.\n\n'\"All in?\" asked James.\n\n'\"All but one boat,\" said the lessor.  \"I can't think where that couple\nis keeping to.  They might run foul of something or other in the dark.\"\n\n'Again Stephen's wife and Olive's husband waited, with more and more\nanxiety.  But no little yellow boat returned.  Was it possible they could\nhave landed further down the Esplanade?\n\n'\"It may have been done to escape paying,\" said the boat-owner.  \"But\nthey didn't look like people who would do that.\"\n\n'James Hardcome knew that he could found no hope on such a reason as\nthat.  But now, remembering what had been casually discussed between\nSteve and himself about their wives from time to time, he admitted for\nthe first time the possibility that their old tenderness had been revived\nby their face-to-face position more strongly than either had anticipated\nat starting--the excursion having been so obviously undertaken for the\npleasure of the performance only,--and that they had landed at some steps\nhe knew of further down toward the pier, to be longer alone together.\n\n'Still he disliked to harbour the thought, and would not mention its\nexistence to his companion.  He merely said to her, \"Let us walk further\non.\"\n\n'They did so, and lingered between the boat-stage and the pier till\nStephen Hardcome's wife was uneasy, and was obliged to accept James's\noffered arm.  Thus the night advanced.  Emily was presently so worn out\nby fatigue that James felt it necessary to conduct her home; there was,\ntoo, a remote chance that the truants had landed in the harbour on the\nother side of the town, or elsewhere, and hastened home in some\nunexpected way, in the belief that their consorts would not have waited\nso long.\n\n'However, he left a direction in the town that a lookout should be kept,\nthough this was arranged privately, the bare possibility of an elopement\nbeing enough to make him reticent; and, full of misgivings, the two\nremaining ones hastened to catch the last train out of Budmouth-Regis;\nand when they got to Casterbridge drove back to Upper Longpuddle.'\n\n'Along this very road as we do now,' remarked the parish clerk.\n\n'To be sure--along this very road,' said the curate.  'However, Stephen\nand Olive were not at their homes; neither had entered the village since\nleaving it in the morning.  Emily and James Hardcome went to their\nrespective dwellings to snatch a hasty night's rest, and at daylight the\nnext morning they drove again to Casterbridge and entered the Budmouth\ntrain, the line being just opened.\n\n'Nothing had been heard of the couple there during this brief absence.  In\nthe course of a few hours some young men testified to having seen such a\nman and woman rowing in a frail hired craft, the head of the boat kept\nstraight to sea; they had sat looking in each other's faces as if they\nwere in a dream, with no consciousness of what they were doing, or\nwhither they were steering.  It was not till late that day that more\ntidings reached James's ears.  The boat had been found drifting bottom\nupward a long way from land.  In the evening the sea rose somewhat, and a\ncry spread through the town that two bodies were cast ashore in Lullstead\nBay, several miles to the eastward.  They were brought to Budmouth, and\ninspection revealed them to be the missing pair.  It was said that they\nhad been found tightly locked in each other's arms, his lips upon hers,\ntheir features still wrapt in the same calm and dream-like repose which\nhad been observed in their demeanour as they had glided along.\n\n'Neither James nor Emily questioned the original motives of the\nunfortunate man and woman in putting to sea.  They were both above\nsuspicion as to intention.  Whatever their mutual feelings might have led\nthem on to, underhand behaviour was foreign to the nature of either.\nConjecture pictured that they might have fallen into tender reverie while\ngazing each into a pair of eyes that had formerly flashed for him and her\nalone, and, unwilling to avow what their mutual sentiments were, they had\ncontinued thus, oblivious of time and space, till darkness suddenly\novertook them far from land.  But nothing was truly known.  It had been\ntheir destiny to die thus.  The two halves, intended by Nature to make\nthe perfect whole, had failed in that result during their lives, though\n\"in their death they were not divided.\"  Their bodies were brought home,\nand buried on one day.  I remember that, on looking round the churchyard\nwhile reading the service, I observed nearly all the parish at their\nfuneral.'\n\n'It was so, sir,' said the clerk.\n\n'The remaining two,' continued the curate (whose voice had grown husky\nwhile relating the lovers' sad fate), 'were a more thoughtful and far-\nseeing, though less romantic, couple than the first.  They were now\nmutually bereft of a companion, and found themselves by this accident in\na position to fulfil their destiny according to Nature's plan and their\nown original and calmly-formed intention.  James Hardcome took Emily to\nwife in the course of a year and a half; and the marriage proved in every\nrespect a happy one.  I solemnized the service, Hardcome having told me,\nwhen he came to give notice of the proposed wedding, the story of his\nfirst wife's loss almost word for word as I have told it to you.'\n\n'And are they living in Longpuddle still?' asked the new-comer.\n\n'O no, sir,' interposed the clerk.  'James has been dead these dozen\nyears, and his mis'ess about six or seven.  They had no children.  William\nPrivett used to be their odd man till he died.'\n\n'Ah--William Privett!  He dead too?--dear me!' said the other.  'All\npassed away!'\n\n'Yes, sir.  William was much older than I.  He'd ha' been over eighty if\nhe had lived till now.'\n\n'There was something very strange about William's death--very strange\nindeed!' sighed a melancholy man in the back of the van.  It was the\nseedsman's father, who had hitherto kept silence.\n\n'And what might that have been?' asked Mr. Lackland.\n\n","no i.m waiting my brother..","\n'Talking of Exhibitions, World's Fairs, and what not,' said the old\ngentleman, 'I would not go round the corner to see a dozen of them\nnowadays.  The only exhibition that ever made, or ever will make, any\nimpression upon my imagination was the first of the series, the parent of\nthem all, and now a thing of old times--the Great Exhibition of 1851, in\nHyde Park, London.  None of the younger generation can realize the sense\nof novelty it produced in us who were then in our prime.  A noun\nsubstantive went so far as to become an adjective in honour of the\noccasion.  It was \"exhibition\" hat, \"exhibition\" razor-strop,\n\"exhibition\" watch; nay, even \"exhibition\" weather, \"exhibition\" spirits,\nsweethearts, babies, wives--for the time.\n\n'For South Wessex, the year formed in many ways an extraordinary\nchronological frontier or transit-line, at which there occurred what one\nmight call a precipice in Time.  As in a geological \"fault,\" we had\npresented to us a sudden bringing of ancient and modern into absolute\ncontact, such as probably in no other single year since the Conquest was\never witnessed in this part of the country.'\n\nThese observations led us onward to talk of the different personages,\ngentle and simple, who lived and moved within our narrow and peaceful\nhorizon at that time; and of three people in particular, whose queer\nlittle history was oddly touched at points by the Exhibition, more\nconcerned with it than that of anybody else who dwelt in those outlying\nshades of the world, Stickleford, Mellstock, and Egdon.  First in\nprominence among these three came Wat Ollamoor--if that were his real\nname--whom the seniors in our party had known well.\n\nHe was a woman's man, they said,--supremely so--externally little else.\nTo men he was not attractive; perhaps a little repulsive at times.\nMusician, dandy, and company-man in practice; veterinary surgeon in\ntheory, he lodged awhile in Mellstock village, coming from nobody knew\nwhere; though some said his first appearance in this neighbourhood had\nbeen as fiddle-player in a show at Greenhill Fair.\n\nMany a worthy villager envied him his power over unsophisticated\nmaidenhood--a power which seemed sometimes to have a touch of the weird\nand wizardly in it.  Personally he was not ill-favoured, though rather un-\nEnglish, his complexion being a rich olive, his rank hair dark and rather\nclammy--made still clammier by secret ointments, which, when he came\nfresh to a party, caused him to smell like 'boys'-love' (southernwood)\nsteeped in lamp-oil.  On occasion he wore curls--a double row--running\nalmost horizontally around his head.  But as these were sometimes\nnoticeably absent, it was concluded that they were not altogether of\nNature's making.  By girls whose love for him had turned to hatred he had\nbeen nicknamed 'Mop,' from this abundance of hair, which was long enough\nto rest upon his shoulders; as time passed the name more and more\nprevailed.\n\nHis fiddling possibly had the most to do with the fascination he\nexercised, for, to speak fairly, it could claim for itself a most\npeculiar and personal quality, like that in a moving preacher.  There\nwere tones in it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and\naverseness to systematic application were all that lay between 'Mop' and\nthe career of a second Paganini.\n\nWhile playing he invariably closed his eyes; using no notes, and, as it\nwere, allowing the violin to wander on at will into the most plaintive\npassages ever heard by rustic man.  There was a certain lingual character\nin the supplicatory expressions he produced, which would well nigh have\ndrawn an ache from the heart of a gate-post.  He could make any child in\nthe parish, who was at all sensitive to music, burst into tears in a few\nminutes by simply fiddling one of the old dance-tunes he almost entirely\naffected--country jigs, reels, and 'Favourite Quick Steps' of the last\ncentury--some mutilated remains of which even now reappear as nameless\nphantoms in new quadrilles and gallops, where they are recognized only by\nthe curious, or by such old-fashioned and far-between people as have been\nthrown with men like Wat Ollamoor in their early life.\n\nHis date was a little later than that of the old Mellstock quire-band\nwhich comprised the Dewys, Mail, and the rest--in fact, he did not rise\nabove the horizon thereabout till those well-known musicians were\ndisbanded as ecclesiastical functionaries.  In their honest love of\nthoroughness they despised the new man's style.  Theophilus Dewy (Reuben\nthe tranter's younger brother) used to say there was no 'plumness' in\nit--no bowing, no solidity--it was all fantastical.  And probably this\nwas true.  Anyhow, Mop had, very obviously, never bowed a note of church-\nmusic from his birth; he never once sat in the gallery of Mellstock\nchurch where the others had tuned their venerable psalmody so many\nhundreds of times; had never, in all likelihood, entered a church at all.\nAll were devil's tunes in his repertory.  'He could no more play the Wold\nHundredth to his true time than he could play the brazen serpent,' the\ntranter would say.  (The brazen serpent was supposed in Mellstock to be a\nmusical instrument particularly hard to blow.)\n\nOccasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the souls\nof grown-up persons, especially young women of fragile and responsive\norganization.  Such an one was Car'line Aspent.  Though she was already\nengaged to be married before she met him, Car'line, of them all, was the\nmost influenced by Mop Ollamoor's heart-stealing melodies, to her\ndiscomfort, nay, positive pain and ultimate injury.  She was a pretty,\ninvocating, weak-mouthed girl, whose chief defect as a companion with her\nsex was a tendency to peevishness now and then.  At this time she was not\na resident in Mellstock parish where Mop lodged, but lived some miles off\nat Stickleford, farther down the river.\n\nHow and where she first made acquaintance with him and his fiddling is\nnot truly known, but the story was that it either began or was developed\non one spring evening, when, in passing through Lower Mellstock, she\nchanced to pause on the bridge near his house to rest herself, and\nlanguidly leaned over the parapet.  Mop was standing on his door-step, as\nwas his custom, spinning the insidious thread of semi- and\ndemi-semi-quavers from the E string of his fiddle for the benefit of\npassers-by, and laughing as the tears rolled down the cheeks of the\nlittle children hanging around him.  Car'line pretended to be engrossed\nwith the rippling of the stream under the arches, but in reality she was\nlistening, as he knew.  Presently the aching of the heart seized her\nsimultaneously with a wild desire to glide airily in the mazes of an\ninfinite dance.  To shake off the fascination she resolved to go on,\nalthough it would be necessary to pass him as he played.  On stealthily\nglancing ahead at the performer, she found to her relief that his eyes\nwere closed in abandonment to instrumentation, and she strode on boldly.\nBut when closer her step grew timid, her tread convulsed itself more and\nmore accordantly with the time of the melody, till she very nearly danced\nalong.  Gaining another glance at him when immediately opposite, she saw\nthat _one_ of his eyes was open, quizzing her as he smiled at her\nemotional state.  Her gait could not divest itself of its compelled\ncapers till she had gone a long way past the house; and Car'line was\nunable to shake off the strange infatuation for hours.\n\nAfter that day, whenever there was to be in the neighbourhood a dance to\nwhich she could get an invitation, and where Mop Ollamoor was to be the\nmusician, Car'line contrived to be present, though it sometimes involved\na walk of several miles; for he did not play so often in Stickleford as\nelsewhere.\n\nThe next evidences of his influence over her were singular enough, and it\nwould require a neurologist to fully explain them.  She would be sitting\nquietly, any evening after dark, in the house of her father, the parish\nclerk, which stood in the middle of Stickleford village street, this\nbeing the highroad between Lower Mellstock and Moreford, five miles\neastward.  Here, without a moment's warning, and in the midst of a\ngeneral conversation between her father, sister, and the young man before\nalluded to, who devotedly wooed her in ignorance of her infatuation, she\nwould start from her seat in the chimney-corner as if she had received a\ngalvanic shock, and spring convulsively towards the ceiling; then she\nwould burst into tears, and it was not till some half-hour had passed\nthat she grew calm as usual.  Her father, knowing her hysterical\ntendencies, was always excessively anxious about this trait in his\nyoungest girl, and feared the attack to be a species of epileptic fit.\nNot so her sister Julia.  Julia had found out what was the cause.  At the\nmoment before the jumping, only an exceptionally sensitive ear situated\nin the chimney-nook could have caught from down the flue the beat of a\nman's footstep along the highway without.  But it was in that footfall,\nfor which she had been waiting, that the origin of Car'line's involuntary\nspringing lay.  The pedestrian was Mop Ollamoor, as the girl well knew;\nbut his business that way was not to visit her; he sought another woman\nwhom he spoke of as his Intended, and who lived at Moreford, two miles\nfarther on.  On one, and only one, occasion did it happen that Car'line\ncould not control her utterance; it was when her sister alone chanced to\nbe present.  'Oh--oh--oh--!' she cried.  'He's going to _her_, and not\ncoming to _me_!'\n\nTo do the fiddler justice he had not at first thought greatly of, or\nspoken much to, this girl of impressionable mould.  But he had soon found\nout her secret, and could not resist a little by-play with her too easily\nhurt heart, as an interlude between his more serious performances at\nMoreford.  The two became well acquainted, though only by stealth, hardly\na soul in Stickleford except her sister, and her lover Ned Hipcroft,\nbeing aware of the attachment.  Her father disapproved of her coldness to\nNed; her sister, too, hoped she might get over this nervous passion for a\nman of whom so little was known.  The ultimate result was that Car'line's\nmanly and simple wooer Edward found his suit becoming practically\nhopeless.  He was a respectable mechanic, in a far sounder position than\nMop the nominal horse-doctor; but when, before leaving her, Ned put his\nflat and final question, would she marry him, then and there, now or\nnever, it was with little expectation of obtaining more than the negative\nshe gave him.  Though her father supported him and her sister supported\nhim, he could not play the fiddle so as to draw your soul out of your\nbody like a spider's thread, as Mop did, till you felt as limp as withy-\nwind and yearned for something to cling to.  Indeed, Hipcroft had not the\nslightest ear for music; could not sing two notes in tune, much less play\nthem.\n\nThe No he had expected and got from her, in spite of a preliminary\nencouragement, gave Ned a new start in life.  It had been uttered in such\na tone of sad entreaty that he resolved to persecute her no more; she\nshould not even be distressed by a sight of his form in the distant\nperspective of the street and lane.  He left the place, and his natural\ncourse was to London.\n\nThe railway to South Wessex was in process of construction, but it was\nnot as yet opened for traffic; and Hipcroft reached the capital by a six\ndays' trudge on foot, as many a better man had done before him.  He was\none of the last of the artisan class who used that now extinct method of\ntravel to the great centres of labour, so customary then from time\nimmemorial.\n\nIn London he lived and worked regularly at his trade.  More fortunate\nthan many, his disinterested willingness recommended him from the first.\nDuring the ensuing four years he was never out of employment.  He neither\nadvanced nor receded in the modern sense; he improved as a workman, but\nhe did not shift one jot in social position.  About his love for Car'line\nhe maintained a rigid silence.  No doubt he often thought of her; but\nbeing always occupied, and having no relations at Stickleford, he held no\ncommunication with that part of the country, and showed no desire to\nreturn.  In his quiet lodging in Lambeth he moved about after working-\nhours with the facility of a woman, doing his own cooking, attending to\nhis stocking-heels, and shaping himself by degrees to a life-long\nbachelorhood.  For this conduct one is bound to advance the canonical\nreason that time could not efface from his heart the image of little\nCar'line Aspent--and it may be in part true; but there was also the\ninference that his was a nature not greatly dependent upon the\nministrations of the other sex for its comforts.\n\nThe fourth year of his residence as a mechanic in London was the year of\nthe Hyde-Park Exhibition already mentioned, and at the construction of\nthis huge glass-house, then unexampled in the world's history, he worked\ndaily.  It was an era of great hope and activity among the nations and\nindustries.  Though Hipcroft was, in his small way, a central man in the\nmovement, he plodded on with his usual outward placidity.  Yet for him,\ntoo, the year was destined to have its surprises, for when the bustle of\ngetting the building ready for the opening day was past, the ceremonies\nhad been witnessed, and people were flocking thither from all parts of\nthe globe, he received a letter from Car'line.  Till that day the silence\nof four years between himself and Stickleford had never been broken.\n\nShe informed her old lover, in an uncertain penmanship which suggested a\ntrembling hand, of the trouble she had been put to in ascertaining his\naddress, and then broached the subject which had prompted her to write.\nFour years ago, she said with the greatest delicacy of which she was\ncapable, she had been so foolish as to refuse him.  Her wilful\nwrong-headedness had since been a grief to her many times, and of late\nparticularly.  As for Mr. Ollamoor, he had been absent almost as long as\nNed--she did not know where.  She would gladly marry Ned now if he were\nto ask her again, and be a tender little wife to him till her life's end.\n\nA tide of warm feeling must have surged through Ned Hipcroft's frame on\nreceipt of this news, if we may judge by the issue.  Unquestionably he\nloved her still, even if not to the exclusion of every other happiness.\nThis from his Car'line, she who had been dead to him these many years,\nalive to him again as of old, was in itself a pleasant, gratifying thing.\nNed had grown so resigned to, or satisfied with, his lonely lot, that he\nprobably would not have shown much jubilation at anything.  Still, a\ncertain ardour of preoccupation, after his first surprise, revealed how\ndeeply her confession of faith in him had stirred him.  Measured and\nmethodical in his ways, he did not answer the letter that day, nor the\nnext, nor the next.  He was having 'a good think.'  When he did answer\nit, there was a great deal of sound reasoning mixed in with the\nunmistakable tenderness of his reply; but the tenderness itself was\nsufficient to reveal that he was pleased with her straightforward\nfrankness; that the anchorage she had once obtained in his heart was\nrenewable, if it had not been continuously firm.\n\nHe told her--and as he wrote his lips twitched humorously over the few\ngentle words of raillery he indited among the rest of his sentences--that\nit was all very well for her to come round at this time of day.  Why\nwouldn't she have him when he wanted her?  She had no doubt learned that\nhe was not married, but suppose his affections had since been fixed on\nanother?  She ought to beg his pardon.  Still, he was not the man to\nforget her.  But considering how he had been used, and what he had\nsuffered, she could not quite expect him to go down to Stickleford and\nfetch her.  But if she would come to him, and say she was sorry, as was\nonly fair; why, yes, he would marry her, knowing what a good little woman\nshe was at the core.  He added that the request for her to come to him\nwas a less one to make than it would have been when he first left\nStickleford, or even a few months ago; for the new railway into South\nWessex was now open, and there had just begun to be run wonderfully\ncontrived special trains, called excursion-trains, on account of the\nGreat Exhibition; so that she could come up easily alone.\n\nShe said in her reply how good it was of him to treat her so generously,\nafter her hot and cold treatment of him; that though she felt frightened\nat the magnitude of the journey, and was never as yet in a railway-train,\nhaving only seen one pass at a distance, she embraced his offer with all\nher heart; and would, indeed, own to him how sorry she was, and beg his\npardon, and try to be a good wife always, and make up for lost time.\n\nThe remaining details of when and where were soon settled, Car'line\ninforming him, for her ready identification in the crowd, that she would\nbe wearing 'my new sprigged-laylock cotton gown,' and Ned gaily\nresponding that, having married her the morning after her arrival, he\nwould make a day of it by taking her to the Exhibition.  One early summer\nafternoon, accordingly, he came from his place of work, and hastened\ntowards Waterloo Station to meet her.  It was as wet and chilly as an\nEnglish June day can occasionally be, but as he waited on the platform in\nthe drizzle he glowed inwardly, and seemed to have something to live for\nagain.\n\nThe 'excursion-train'--an absolutely new departure in the history of\ntravel--was still a novelty on the Wessex line, and probably everywhere.\nCrowds of people had flocked to all the stations on the way up to witness\nthe unwonted sight of so long a train's passage, even where they did not\ntake advantage of the opportunity it offered.  The seats for the humbler\nclass of travellers in these early experiments in steam-locomotion, were\nopen trucks, without any protection whatever from the wind and rain; and\ndamp weather having set in with the afternoon, the unfortunate occupants\nof these vehicles were, on the train drawing up at the London terminus,\nfound to be in a pitiable condition from their long journey; blue-faced,\nstiff-necked, sneezing, rain-beaten, chilled to the marrow, many of the\nmen being hatless; in fact, they resembled people who had been out all\nnight in an open boat on a rough sea, rather than inland excursionists\nfor pleasure.  The women had in some degree protected themselves by\nturning up the skirts of their gowns over their heads, but as by this\narrangement they were additionally exposed about the hips, they were all\nmore or less in a sorry plight.\n\nIn the bustle and crush of alighting forms of both sexes which followed\nthe entry of the huge concatenation into the station, Ned Hipcroft soon\ndiscerned the slim little figure his eye was in search of, in the\nsprigged lilac, as described.  She came up to him with a frightened\nsmile--still pretty, though so damp, weather-beaten, and shivering from\nlong exposure to the wind.\n\n'O Ned!' she sputtered, 'I--I--'  He clasped her in his arms and kissed\nher, whereupon she burst into a flood of tears.\n\n'You are wet, my poor dear!  I hope you'll not get cold,' he said.  And\nsurveying her and her multifarious surrounding packages, he noticed that\nby the hand she led a toddling child--a little girl of three or so--whose\nhood was as clammy and tender face as blue as those of the other\ntravellers.\n\n'Who is this--somebody you know?' asked Ned curiously.\n\n'Yes, Ned.  She's mine.'\n\n'Yours?'\n\n'Yes--my own!'\n\n'Your own child?'\n\n'Yes!'\n\n'Well--as God's in--'\n\n'Ned, I didn't name it in my letter, because, you see, it would have been\nso hard to explain!  I thought that when we met I could tell you how she\nhappened to be born, so much better than in writing!  I hope you'll\nexcuse it this once, dear Ned, and not scold me, now I've come so many,\nmany miles!'\n\n'This means Mr. Mop Ollamoor, I reckon!' said Hipcroft, gazing palely at\nthem from the distance of the yard or two to which he had withdrawn with\na start.\n\nCar'line gasped.  'But he's been gone away for years!' she supplicated.\n'And I never had a young man before!  And I was so onlucky to be catched\nthe first time, though some of the girls down there go on like anything!'\n\nNed remained in silence, pondering.\n\n'You'll forgive me, dear Ned?' she added, beginning to sob outright.  'I\nhaven't taken 'ee in after all, because--because you can pack us back\nagain, if you want to; though 'tis hundreds o' miles, and so wet, and\nnight a-coming on, and I with no money!'\n\n'What the devil can I do!' Hipcroft groaned.\n\nA more pitiable picture than the pair of helpless creatures presented was\nnever seen on a rainy day, as they stood on the great, gaunt, puddled\nplatform, a whiff of drizzle blowing under the roof upon them now and\nthen; the pretty attire in which they had started from Stickleford in the\nearly morning bemuddled and sodden, weariness on their faces, and fear of\nhim in their eyes; for the child began to look as if she thought she too\nhad done some wrong, remaining in an appalled silence till the tears\nrolled down her chubby cheeks.\n\n'What's the matter, my little maid?' said Ned mechanically.\n\n'I do want to go home!' she let out, in tones that told of a bursting\nheart.  'And my totties be cold, an' I shan't have no bread an' butter no\nmore!'\n\n'I don't know what to say to it all!' declared Ned, his own eye moist as\nhe turned and walked a few steps with his head down; then regarded them\nagain point blank.  From the child escaped troubled breaths and silently\nwelling tears.\n\n'Want some bread and butter, do 'ee?' he said, with factitious hardness.\n\n'Ye-e-s!'\n\n'Well, I daresay I can get 'ee a bit!  Naturally, you must want some.  And\nyou, too, for that matter, Car'line.'\n\n'I do feel a little hungered.  But I can keep it off,' she murmured.\n\n'Folk shouldn't do that,' he said gruffly. . . . 'There come along!' he\ncaught up the child, as he added, 'You must bide here to-night, anyhow, I\ns'pose!  What can you do otherwise?  I'll get 'ee some tea and victuals;\nand as for this job, I'm sure I don't know what to say!  This is the way\nout.'\n\nThey pursued their way, without speaking, to Ned's lodgings, which were\nnot far off.  There he dried them and made them comfortable, and prepared\ntea; they thankfully sat down.  The ready-made household of which he\nsuddenly found himself the head imparted a cosy aspect to his room, and a\npaternal one to himself.  Presently he turned to the child and kissed her\nnow blooming cheeks; and, looking wistfully at Car'line, kissed her also.\n\n'I don't see how I can send 'ee back all them miles,' he growled, 'now\nyou've come all the way o' purpose to join me.  But you must trust me,\nCar'line, and show you've real faith in me.  Well, do you feel better\nnow, my little woman?'\n\nThe child nodded, her mouth being otherwise occupied.\n\n'I did trust you, Ned, in coming; and I shall always!'\n\nThus, without any definite agreement to forgive her, he tacitly\nacquiesced in the fate that Heaven had sent him; and on the day of their\nmarriage (which was not quite so soon as he had expected it could be, on\naccount of the time necessary for banns) he took her to the Exhibition\nwhen they came back from church, as he had promised.  While standing near\na large mirror in one of the courts devoted to furniture, Car'line\nstarted, for in the glass appeared the reflection of a form exactly\nresembling Mop Ollamoor's--so exactly, that it seemed impossible to\nbelieve anybody but that artist in person to be the original.  On passing\nround the objects which hemmed in Ned, her, and the child from a direct\nview, no Mop was to be seen.  Whether he were really in London or not at\nthat time was never known; and Car'line always stoutly denied that her\nreadiness to go and meet Ned in town arose from any rumour that Mop had\nalso gone thither; which denial there was no reasonable ground for\ndoubting.\n\nAnd then the year glided away, and the Exhibition folded itself up and\nbecame a thing of the past.  The park trees that had been enclosed for\nsix months were again exposed to the winds and storms, and the sod grew\ngreen anew.  Ned found that Car'line resolved herself into a very good\nwife and companion, though she had made herself what is called cheap to\nhim; but in that she was like another domestic article, a cheap tea-pot,\nwhich often brews better tea than a dear one.  One autumn Hipcroft found\nhimself with but little work to do, and a prospect of less for the\nwinter.  Both being country born and bred, they fancied they would like\nto live again in their natural atmosphere.  It was accordingly decided\nbetween them that they should leave the pent-up London lodging, and that\nNed should seek out employment near his native place, his wife and her\ndaughter staying with Car'line's father during the search for occupation\nand an abode of their own.\n\nTinglings of pleasure pervaded Car'line's spasmodic little frame as she\njourneyed down with Ned to the place she had left two or three years\nbefore, in silence and under a cloud.  To return to where she had once\nbeen despised, a smiling London wife with a distinct London accent, was a\ntriumph which the world did not witness every day.\n\nThe train did not stop at the petty roadside station that lay nearest to\nStickleford, and the trio went on to Casterbridge.  Ned thought it a good\nopportunity to make a few preliminary inquiries for employment at\nworkshops in the borough where he had been known; and feeling cold from\nher journey, and it being dry underfoot and only dusk as yet, with a moon\non the point of rising, Car'line and her little girl walked on toward\nStickleford, leaving Ned to follow at a quicker pace, and pick her up at\na certain half-way house, widely known as an inn.\n\nThe woman and child pursued the well-remembered way comfortably enough,\nthough they were both becoming wearied.  In the course of three miles\nthey had passed Heedless-William's Pond, the familiar landmark by Bloom's\nEnd, and were drawing near the Quiet Woman Inn, a lone roadside hostel on\nthe lower verge of the Egdon Heath, since and for many years abolished.\nIn stepping up towards it Car'line heard more voices within than had\nformerly been customary at such an hour, and she learned that an auction\nof fat stock had been held near the spot that afternoon.  The child would\nbe the better for a rest as well as herself, she thought, and she\nentered.\n\nThe guests and customers overflowed into the passage, and Car'line had no\nsooner crossed the threshold than a man whom she remembered by sight came\nforward with glass and mug in his hands towards a friend leaning against\nthe wall; but, seeing her, very gallantly offered her a drink of the\nliquor, which was gin-and-beer hot, pouring her out a tumblerful and\nsaying, in a moment or two: 'Surely, 'tis little Car'line Aspent that\nwas--down at Stickleford?'\n\nShe assented, and, though she did not exactly want this beverage, she\ndrank it since it was offered, and her entertainer begged her to come in\nfarther and sit down.  Once within the room she found that all the\npersons present were seated close against the walls, and there being a\nchair vacant she did the same.  An explanation of their position occurred\nthe next moment.  In the opposite corner stood Mop, rosining his bow and\nlooking just the same as ever.  The company had cleared the middle of the\nroom for dancing, and they were about to dance again.  As she wore a veil\nto keep off the wind she did not think he had recognized her, or could\npossibly guess the identity of the child; and to her satisfied surprise\nshe found that she could confront him quite calmly--mistress of herself\nin the dignity her London life had given her.  Before she had quite\nemptied her glass the dance was called, the dancers formed in two lines,\nthe music sounded, and the figure began.\n\nThen matters changed for Car'line.  A tremor quickened itself to life in\nher, and her hand so shook that she could hardly set down her glass.  It\nwas not the dance nor the dancers, but the notes of that old violin which\nthrilled the London wife, these having still all the witchery that she\nhad so well known of yore, and under which she had used to lose her power\nof independent will.  How it all came back!  There was the fiddling\nfigure against the wall; the large, oily, mop-like head of him, and\nbeneath the mop the face with closed eyes.\n\nAfter the first moments of paralyzed reverie the familiar tune in the\nfamiliar rendering made her laugh and shed tears simultaneously.  Then a\nman at the bottom of the dance, whose partner had dropped away, stretched\nout his hand and beckoned to her to take the place.  She did not want to\ndance; she entreated by signs to be left where she was, but she was\nentreating of the tune and its player rather than of the dancing man.  The\nsaltatory tendency which the fiddler and his cunning instrument had ever\nbeen able to start in her was seizing Car'line just as it had done in\nearlier years, possibly assisted by the gin-and-beer hot.  Tired as she\nwas she grasped her little girl by the hand, and plunging in at the\nbottom of the figure, whirled about with the rest.  She found that her\ncompanions were mostly people of the neighbouring hamlets and\nfarms--Bloom's End, Mellstock, Lewgate, and elsewhere; and by degrees she\nwas recognized as she convulsively danced on, wishing that Mop would\ncease and let her heart rest from the aching he caused, and her feet\nalso.\n\nAfter long and many minutes the dance ended, when she was urged to\nfortify herself with more gin-and-beer; which she did, feeling very weak\nand overpowered with hysteric emotion.  She refrained from unveiling, to\nkeep Mop in ignorance of her presence, if possible.  Several of the\nguests having left, Car'line hastily wiped her lips and also turned to\ngo; but, according to the account of some who remained, at that very\nmoment a five-handed reel was proposed, in which two or three begged her\nto join.\n\nShe declined on the plea of being tired and having to walk to\nStickleford, when Mop began aggressively tweedling 'My Fancy-Lad,' in D\nmajor, as the air to which the reel was to be footed.  He must have\nrecognized her, though she did not know it, for it was the strain of all\nseductive strains which she was least able to resist--the one he had\nplayed when she was leaning over the bridge at the date of their first\nacquaintance.  Car'line stepped despairingly into the middle of the room\nwith the other four.\n\nReels were resorted to hereabouts at this time by the more robust\nspirits, for the reduction of superfluous energy which the ordinary\nfigure-dances were not powerful enough to exhaust.  As everybody knows,\nor does not know, the five reelers stood in the form of a cross, the reel\nbeing performed by each line of three alternately, the persons who\nsuccessively came to the middle place dancing in both directions.\nCar'line soon found herself in this place, the axis of the whole\nperformance, and could not get out of it, the tune turning into the first\npart without giving her opportunity.  And now she began to suspect that\nMop did know her, and was doing this on purpose, though whenever she\nstole a glance at him his closed eyes betokened obliviousness to\neverything outside his own brain.  She continued to wend her way through\nthe figure of 8 that was formed by her course, the fiddler introducing\ninto his notes the wild and agonizing sweetness of a living voice in one\ntoo highly wrought; its pathos running high and running low in endless\nvariation, projecting through her nerves excruciating spasms, a sort of\nblissful torture.  The room swam, the tune was endless; and in about a\nquarter of an hour the only other woman in the figure dropped out\nexhausted, and sank panting on a bench.\n\nThe reel instantly resolved itself into a four-handed one.  Car'line\nwould have given anything to leave off; but she had, or fancied she had,\nno power, while Mop played such tunes; and thus another ten minutes\nslipped by, a haze of dust now clouding the candles, the floor being of\nstone, sanded.  Then another dancer fell out--one of the men--and went\ninto the passage, in a frantic search for liquor.  To turn the figure\ninto a three-handed reel was the work of a second, Mop modulating at the\nsame time into 'The Fairy Dance,' as better suited to the contracted\nmovement, and no less one of those foods of love which, as manufactured\nby his bow, had always intoxicated her.\n\nIn a reel for three there was no rest whatever, and four or five minutes\nwere enough to make her remaining two partners, now thoroughly blown,\nstamp their last bar and, like their predecessors, limp off into the next\nroom to get something to drink.  Car'line, half-stifled inside her veil,\nwas left dancing alone, the apartment now being empty of everybody save\nherself, Mop, and their little girl.\n\nShe flung up the veil, and cast her eyes upon him, as if imploring him to\nwithdraw himself and his acoustic magnetism from the atmosphere.  Mop\nopened one of his own orbs, as though for the first time, fixed it\npeeringly upon her, and smiling dreamily, threw into his strains the\nreserve of expression which he could not afford to waste on a big and\nnoisy dance.  Crowds of little chromatic subtleties, capable of drawing\ntears from a statue, proceeded straightway from the ancient fiddle, as if\nit were dying of the emotion which had been pent up within it ever since\nits banishment from some Italian city where it first took shape and\nsound.  There was that in the look of Mop's one dark eye which said: 'You\ncannot leave off, dear, whether you would or no!' and it bred in her a\nparoxysm of desperation that defied him to tire her down.\n\nShe thus continued to dance alone, defiantly as she thought, but in truth\nslavishly and abjectly, subject to every wave of the melody, and probed\nby the gimlet-like gaze of her fascinator's open eye; keeping up at the\nsame time a feeble smile in his face, as a feint to signify it was still\nher own pleasure which led her on.  A terrified embarrassment as to what\nshe could say to him if she were to leave off, had its unrecognized share\nin keeping her going.  The child, who was beginning to be distressed by\nthe strange situation, came up and said: 'Stop, mother, stop, and let's\ngo home!' as she seized Car'line's hand.\n\nSuddenly Car'line sank staggering to the floor; and rolling over on her\nface, prone she remained.  Mop's fiddle thereupon emitted an elfin shriek\nof finality; stepping quickly down from the nine-gallon beer-cask which\nhad formed his rostrum, he went to the little girl, who disconsolately\nbent over her mother.\n\nThe guests who had gone into the back-room for liquor and change of air,\nhearing something unusual, trooped back hitherward, where they\nendeavoured to revive poor, weak Car'line by blowing her with the bellows\nand opening the window.  Ned, her husband, who had been detained in\nCasterbridge, as aforesaid, came along the road at this juncture, and\nhearing excited voices through the open casement, and to his great\nsurprise, the mention of his wife's name, he entered amid the rest upon\nthe scene.  Car'line was now in convulsions, weeping violently, and for a\nlong time nothing could be done with her.  While he was sending for a\ncart to take her onward to Stickleford Hipcroft anxiously inquired how it\nhad all happened; and then the assembly explained that a fiddler formerly\nknown in the locality had lately revisited his old haunts, and had taken\nupon himself without invitation to play that evening at the inn.\n\nNed demanded the fiddler's name, and they said Ollamoor.\n\n'Ah!' exclaimed Ned, looking round him.  'Where is he, and where--where's\nmy little girl?'\n\nOllamoor had disappeared, and so had the child.  Hipcroft was in ordinary\na quiet and tractable fellow, but a determination which was to be feared\nsettled in his face now.  'Blast him!' he cried.  'I'll beat his skull in\nfor'n, if I swing for it to-morrow!'\n\nHe had rushed to the poker which lay on the hearth, and hastened down the\npassage, the people following.  Outside the house, on the other side of\nthe highway, a mass of dark heath-land rose sullenly upward to its not\neasily accessible interior, a ravined plateau, whereon jutted into the\nsky, at the distance of a couple of miles, the fir-woods of Mistover\nbacked by the Yalbury coppices--a place of Dantesque gloom at this hour,\nwhich would have afforded secure hiding for a battery of artillery, much\nless a man and a child.\n\nSome other men plunged thitherward with him, and more went along the\nroad.  They were gone about twenty minutes altogether, returning without\nresult to the inn.  Ned sat down in the settle, and clasped his forehead\nwith his hands.\n\n'Well--what a fool the man is, and hev been all these years, if he thinks\nthe child his, as a' do seem to!' they whispered.  'And everybody else\nknowing otherwise!'\n\n'No, I don't think 'tis mine!' cried Ned hoarsely, as he looked up from\nhis hands.  'But she is mine, all the same!  Ha'n't I nussed her?  Ha'n't\nI fed her and teached her?  Ha'n't I played wi' her?  O, little\nCarry--gone with that rogue--gone!'\n\n'You ha'n't lost your mis'ess, anyhow,' they said to console him.  'She's\nthrowed up the sperrits, and she is feeling better, and she's more to 'ee\nthan a child that isn't yours.'\n\n'She isn't!  She's not so particular much to me, especially now she's\nlost the little maid!  But Carry's everything!'\n\n'Well, ver' like you'll find her to-morrow.'\n\n'Ah--but shall I?  Yet he _can't_ hurt her--surely he can't!  Well--how's\nCar'line now?  I am ready.  Is the cart here?'\n\nShe was lifted into the vehicle, and they sadly lumbered on toward\nStickleford.  Next day she was calmer; but the fits were still upon her;\nand her will seemed shattered.  For the child she appeared to show\nsingularly little anxiety, though Ned was nearly distracted.  It was\nnevertheless quite expected that the impish Mop would restore the lost\none after a freak of a day or two; but time went on, and neither he nor\nshe could be heard of, and Hipcroft murmured that perhaps he was\nexercising upon her some unholy musical charm, as he had done upon\nCar'line herself.  Weeks passed, and still they could obtain no clue\neither to the fiddler's whereabouts or the girl's; and how he could have\ninduced her to go with him remained a mystery.\n\nThen Ned, who had obtained only temporary employment in the\nneighbourhood, took a sudden hatred toward his native district, and a\nrumour reaching his ears through the police that a somewhat similar man\nand child had been seen at a fair near London, he playing a violin, she\ndancing on stilts, a new interest in the capital took possession of\nHipcroft with an intensity which would scarcely allow him time to pack\nbefore returning thither.\n\nHe did not, however, find the lost one, though he made it the entire\nbusiness of his over-hours to stand about in by-streets in the hope of\ndiscovering her, and would start up in the night, saying, 'That rascal's\ntorturing her to maintain him!'  To which his wife would answer\npeevishly, 'Don't 'ee raft yourself so, Ned!  You prevent my getting a\nbit o' rest!  He won't hurt her!' and fall asleep again.\n\nThat Carry and her father had emigrated to America was the general\nopinion; Mop, no doubt, finding the girl a highly desirable companion\nwhen he had trained her to keep him by her earnings as a dancer.  There,\nfor that matter, they may be performing in some capacity now, though he\nmust be an old scamp verging on threescore-and-ten, and she a woman of\nfour-and-forty.\n\n","Is there anybody going to listen to my story\nAll about the girl who came to stay?\nShe's the kind of girl you want so much\nIt makes you sorry;\nStill, you don't regret a single day.\nAh girl! Girl! Girl!\n\nShe's the kind of girl who puts you down\nWhen friends are there, you feel a fool.\nWhen you say she's looking good\nShe acts as if it's understood.\nShe's cool, cool, cool, cool.\n\nWhen I think of all the times I've tried to leave her\nShe will turn to me and start to cry;\nAnd she promises the earth to me\nAnd I believe her.\nAfter all this times I don't know why.\n\nWas she told when she was young the pain\nWould lead to pleasure?\nDid she understand it when they said\nThat a man must break his back to earn\nHis day of leisure?\nWill she still believe it when he's dead?\nAh girl! Girl! Girl!\n\n","Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, and distinguished Members of the House and Senate, honored guests, and fellow citizens:\nLess than 3 weeks ago, I joined you on the West Front of this very building and, looking over the monuments to our proud past, offered you my hand in filling the next page of American history with a story of extended prosperity and continued peace. And tonight I'm back to offer you my plans as well. The hand remains extended; the sleeves are rolled up; America is waiting; and now we must produce. Together, we can build a better America.\nIt is comforting to return to this historic Chamber. Here, 22 years ago, I first raised my hand to be sworn into public life. So, tonight I feel as if I'm returning home to friends. And I intend, in the months and years to come, to give you what friends deserve: frankness, respect, and my best judgment about ways to improve America's future. In return, I ask for an honest commitment to our common mission of progress. If we seize the opportunities on the road before us, there'll be praise enough for all. The people didn't send us here to bicker, and it's time to govern.\nAnd many Presidents have come to this Chamber in times of great crisis: war and depression, loss of national spirit. And 8 years ago, I sat in that very chair as President Reagan spoke of punishing inflation and devastatingly high interest rates and people out of work — American confidence on the wane. And our challenge is different. We're fortunate — a much changed landscape lies before us tonight. So, I don't propose to reverse direction. We're headed the right way, but we cannot rest. We're a people whose energy and drive have fueled our rise to greatness. And we're a forward-looking nation — generous, yes, but ambitious, not for ourselves but for the world. Complacency is not in our character — not before, not now, not ever.\nAnd so, tonight we must take a strong America and make it even better. We must address some very real problems. We must establish some very clear priorities. And we must make a very substantial cut in the Federal budget deficit. Some people find that agenda impossible, but I'm presenting to you tonight a realistic plan for tackling it. My plan has four broad features: attention to urgent priorities, investment in the future, an attack on the deficit, and no new taxes. This budget represents my best judgment of how we can address our priorities. There are many areas in which we would all like to spend more than I propose; I understand that. But we cannot until we get our fiscal house in order.\nNext year alone, thanks to economic growth, without any change in the law, the Federal Government will take in over $80 billion more than it does this year. That's right — over $80 billion in new revenues, with no increases in taxes. And our job is to allocate those new resources wisely. We can afford to increase spending by a modest amount, but enough to invest in key priorities and still cut the deficit by almost 40 percent in 1 year. And that will allow us to meet the targets set forth in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. But to do that, we must recognize that growth above inflation in Federal programs is not preordained, that not all spending initiatives were designed to be immortal.\nI make this pledge tonight: My team and I are ready to work with the Congress, to form a special leadership group, to negotiate in good faith, to work day and night — if that's what it takes — to meet the budget targets and to produce a budget on time.\nWe cannot settle for business as usual. Government by continuing resolution, or government by crisis, will not do. And I ask the Congress tonight to approve several measures which will make budgeting more sensible. We could save time and improve efficiency by enacting 2-year budgets. Forty-three Governors have the line-item veto. Presidents should have it, too. And at the very least, when a President proposes to rescind Federal spending, the Congress should be required to vote on that proposal instead of killing it by inaction. And I ask the Congress to honor the public's wishes by passing a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. Such an amendment, once phased in, will discipline both the Congress and the executive branch.\nSeveral principles describe the kind of America I hope to build with your help in the years ahead. We will not have the luxury of taking the easy, spendthrift approach to solving problems because higher spending and higher taxes put economic growth at risk. Economic growth provides jobs and hope. Economic growth enables us to pay for social programs. Economic growth enhances the security of the Nation, and low tax rates create economic growth.\nI believe in giving Americans greater freedom and greater choice. And I will work for choice for American families, whether in the housing in which they live, the schools to which they send their children, or the child care they select for their young. You see, I believe that we have an obligation to those in need, but that government should not be the provider of first resort for things that the private sector can produce better. I believe in a society that is free from discrimination and bigotry of any kind. And I will work to knock down the barriers left by past discrimination and to build a more tolerant society that will stop such barriers from ever being built again.\nI believe that family and faith represent the moral compass of the Nation. And I'll work to make them strong, for as Benjamin Franklin said: ``If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, can a great nation rise without His aid? And I believe in giving people the power to make their own lives better through growth and opportunity. And together, let's put power in the hands of people.\nThree weeks ago, we celebrated the bicentennial inaugural, the 200th anniversary of the first Presidency. And if you look back, one thing is so striking about the way the Founding Fathers looked at America. They didn't talk about themselves. They talked about posterity. They talked about the future. And we, too, must think in terms bigger than ourselves. We must take actions today that will ensure a better tomorrow. We must extend American leadership in technology, increase long-term investment, improve our educational system, and boost productivity. These are the keys to building a better future, and here are some of my recommendations:\nI propose almost $2.2 billion for the National Science Foundation to promote basic research and keep us on track to double its budget by 1993.\nI propose to make permanent the tax credit for research and development.\nI've asked Vice President Quayle to chair a new Task Force on Competitiveness.\nAnd I request funding for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and a strong space program, an increase of almost $2.4 billion over the current fiscal year. We must have a manned space station; a vigorous, safe space shuttle program; and more commercial development in space. The space program should always go ``full throttle up. And that's not just our ambition; it's our destiny.\nI propose that we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains to increase long-term investment. History on this is clear — this will increase revenues, help savings, and create new jobs. We won't be competitive if we leave whole sectors of America behind. This is the year we should finally enact urban enterprise zones and bring hope to the inner cities.\nBut the most important competitiveness program of all is one which improves education in America. When some of our students actually have trouble locating America on a map of the world, it is time for us to map a new approach to education. We must reward excellence and cut through bureaucracy. We must help schools that need help the most. We must give choice to parents, students, teachers, and principals; and we must hold all concerned accountable. In education, we cannot tolerate mediocrity. I want to cut that dropout rate and make America a more literate nation, because what it really comes down to is this: The longer our graduation lines are today, the shorter our unemployment lines will be tomorrow.\nSo, tonight I'm proposing the following initiatives: the beginning of a $500 million program to reward America's best schools, merit schools; the creation of special Presidential awards for the best teachers in every State, because excellence should be rewarded; the establishment of a new program of National Science Scholars, one each year for every Member of the House and Senate, to give this generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and mathematics; the expanded use of magnet schools, which give families and students greater choice; and a new program to encourage alternative certification, which will let talented people from all fields teach in our classrooms. I've said I'd like to be the ``Education President. And tonight, I'd ask you to join me by becoming the ``Education Congress.\nJust last week, as I settled into this new office, I received a letter from a mother in Pennsylvania who had been struck by my message in the Inaugural Address. ``Not 12 hours before, she wrote, ``my husband and I received word that our son was addicted to cocaine. He had the world at his feet. Bright, gifted, personable — he could have done anything with his life. And now he has chosen cocaine. ``And please, she wrote, ``find a way to curb the supply of cocaine. Get tough with the pushers. Our son needs your help.\nMy friends, that voice crying out for help could be the voice of your own neighbor, your own friend, your own son. Over 23 million Americans used illegal drugs last year, at a staggering cost to our nation's well-being. Let this be recorded as the time when America rose up and said no to drugs. The scourge of drugs must be stopped. And I am asking tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget outlays to escalate the war against drugs. The war must be waged on all fronts. Our new drug czar, Bill Bennett, and I will be shoulder to shoulder in the executive branch leading the charge.\nSome money will be used to expand treatment to the poor and to young mothers. This will offer the helping hand to the many innocent victims of drugs, like the thousands of babies born addicted or with AIDS because of the mother's addiction. Some will be used to cut the waiting time for treatment. Some money will be devoted to those urban schools where the emergency is now the worst. And much of it will be used to protect our borders, with help from the Coast Guard and the Customs Service, the Departments of State and Justice, and, yes, the U.S. military.\nI mean to get tough on the drug criminals. And let me be clear: This President will back up those who put their lives on the line every single day — our local police officers. My budget asks for beefed-up prosecution, for a new attack on organized crime, and for enforcement of tough sentences — and for the worst kingpins, that means the death penalty. I also want to make sure that when a drug dealer is convicted there's a cell waiting for him. And he should not go free because prisons are too full. And so, let the word go out: If you're caught and convicted, you will do time.\nBut for all we do in law enforcement, in interdiction and treatment, we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop the demand for drugs. So, some of this increase will be used to educate the young about the dangers of drugs. We must involve the parents. We must involve the teachers. We must involve the communities. And, my friends, we must involve ourselves, each and every one of us in this concern.\nOne problem related to drug use demands our urgent attention and our continuing compassion, and that is the terrible tragedy of AIDS. I'm asking for $1.6 billion for education to prevent the disease and for research to find a cure.\nIf we're to protect our future, we need a new attitude about the environment. We must protect the air we breathe. I will send to you shortly legislation for a new, more effective Clean Air Act. It will include a plan to reduce by date certain the emissions which cause acid rain, because the time for study alone has passed, and the time for action is now. We must make use of clean coal. My budget contains full funding, on schedule, for the clean coal technology agreement that we've made with Canada. We've made that agreement with Canada, and we intend to honor that agreement. We must not neglect our parks. So, I'm asking to fund new acquisitions under the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We must protect our oceans. And I support new penalties against those who would dump medical waste and other trash into our oceans. The age of the needle on the beaches must end.\nAnd in some cases, the gulfs and oceans off our shores hold the promise of oil and gas reserves which can make our nation more secure and less dependent on foreign oil. And when those with the most promise can be tapped safely, as with much of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, we should proceed. But we must use caution; we must respect the environment. And so, tonight I'm calling for the indefinite postponement of three lease sales which have raised troubling questions, two off the coast of California and one which could threaten the Everglades in Florida. Action on these three lease sales will await the conclusion of a special task force set up to measure the potential for environmental damage.\nI'm directing the Attorney General and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to use every tool at their disposal to speed and toughen the enforcement of our laws against toxic-waste dumpers. I want faster cleanups and tougher enforcement of penalties against polluters.\nIn addition to caring for our future, we must care for those around us. A decent society shows compassion for the young, the elderly, the vulnerable, and the poor. Our first obligation is to the most vulnerable — infants, poor mothers, children living in poverty — and my proposed budget recognizes this. I ask for full funding of Medicaid, an increase of over $3 billion, and an expansion of the program to include coverage of pregnant women who are near the poverty line. I believe we should help working families cope with the burden of child care. Our help should be aimed at those who need it most: low-income families with young children. I support a new child care tax credit that will aim our efforts at exactly those families, without discriminating against mothers who choose to stay at home.\nNow, I know there are competing proposals. But remember this: The overwhelming majority of all preschool child care is now provided by relatives and neighbors and churches and community groups. Families who choose these options should remain eligible for help. Parents should have choice. And for those children who are unwanted or abused or whose parents are deceased, we should encourage adoption. I propose to reenact the tax deduction for adoption expenses and to double it to $3,000. Let's make it easier for these kids to have parents who love them.\nWe have a moral contract with our senior citizens. And in this budget, Social Security is fully funded, including a full cost-of-living adjustment. We must honor our contract.\nWe must care about those in the shadow of life, and I, like many Americans, am deeply troubled by the plight of the homeless. The causes of homelessness are many; the history is long. But the moral imperative to act is clear. Thanks to the deep well of generosity in this great land, many organizations already contribute, but we in government cannot stand on the sidelines. In my budget, I ask for greater support for emergency food and shelter, for health services and measures to prevent substance abuse, and for clinics for the mentally ill. And I propose a new initiative involving the full range of government agencies. We must confront this national shame.\nThere's another issue that I've decided to mention here tonight. I've long believed that the people of Puerto Rico should have the right to determine their own political future. Personally, I strongly favor statehood. But I urge the Congress to take the necessary steps to allow the people to decide in a referendum.\nCertain problems, the result of decades of unwise practices, threaten the health and security of our people. Left unattended, they will only get worse. But we can act now to put them behind us.\nEarlier this week, I announced my support for a plan to restore the financial and moral integrity of our savings system. I ask Congress to enact our reform proposals within 45 days. We must not let this situation fester. We owe it to the savers in this country to solve this problem. Certainly, the savings of Americans must remain secure. Let me be clear: Insured depositors will continue to be fully protected, but any plan to refinance the system must be accompanied by major reform. Our proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring. The best answer is to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again. The majority of thrifts in communities across the Nation have been honest. They've played a major role in helping families achieve the dream of home ownership. But make no mistake, those who are corrupt, those who break the law, must be kicked out of the business; and they should go to jail.\nWe face a massive task in cleaning up the waste left from decades of environmental neglect at America's nuclear weapons plants. Clearly, we must modernize these plants and operate them safely. That's not at issue; our national security depends on it. But beyond that, we must clean up the old mess that's been left behind. And I propose in this budget to more than double our current effort to do so. This will allow us to identify the exact nature of the various problems so we can clean them up, and clean them up we will.\nWe've been fortunate during these past 8 years. America is a stronger nation than it was in 1980. Morale in our Armed Forces has been restored; our resolve has been shown. Our readiness has been improved, and we are at peace. There can no longer be any doubt that peace has been made more secure through strength. And when America is stronger, the world is safer.\nMost people don't realize that after the successful restoration of our strength, the Pentagon budget has actually been reduced in real terms for each of the last 4 years. We cannot tolerate continued real reduction in defense. In light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit, however, I support a 1-year freeze in the military budget, something I proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan. And this freeze will apply for only 1 year, and after that, increases above inflation will be required. I will not sacrifice American preparedness, and I will not compromise American strength.\nI should be clear on the conditions attached to my recommendation for the coming year: The savings must be allocated to those priorities for investing in our future that I've spoken about tonight. This defense freeze must be a part of a comprehensive budget agreement which meets the targets spelled out in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law without raising taxes and which incorporates reforms in the budget process.\nI've directed the National Security Council to review our national security and defense policies and report back to me within 90 days to ensure that our capabilities and resources meet our commitments and strategies. I'm also charging the Department of Defense with the task of developing a plan to improve the defense procurement process and management of the Pentagon, one which will fully implement the Packard commission report. Many of these changes can only be made with the participation of the Congress, and so, I ask for your help. We need fewer regulations. We need less bureaucracy. We need multiyear procurement and 2-year budgeting. And frankly — and don't take this wrong — we need less congressional micromanagement of our nation's military policy. I detect a slight division on that question, but nevertheless.\nSecuring a more peaceful world is perhaps the most important priority I'd like to address tonight. You know, we meet at a time of extraordinary hope. Never before in this century have our values of freedom, democracy, and economic opportunity been such a powerful and intellectual force around the globe. Never before has our leadership been so crucial, because while America has its eyes on the future, the world has its eyes on America.\nAnd it's a time of great change in the world, and especially in the Soviet Union. Prudence and common sense dictate that we try to understand the full meaning of the change going on there, review our policies, and then proceed with caution. But I've personally assured General Secretary Gorbachev that at the conclusion of such a review we will be ready to move forward. We will not miss any opportunity to work for peace. The fundamental facts remain that the Soviets retain a very powerful military machine in the service of objectives which are still too often in conflict with ours. So, let us take the new openness seriously, but let's also be realistic. And let's always be strong.\nThere are some pressing issues we must address. I will vigorously pursue the Strategic Defense Initiative. The spread, and even use, of sophisticated weaponry threatens global security as never before. Chemical weapons must be banned from the face of the Earth, never to be used again. And look, this won't be easy. Verification — extraordinarily difficult, but civilization and human decency demand that we try. And the spread of nuclear weapons must be stopped. And I'll work to strengthen the hand of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Our diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\nAnd around the globe, we must continue to be freedom's best friend. And we must stand firm for self-determination and democracy in Central America, including in Nicaragua. It is my strongly held conviction that when people are given the chance they inevitably will choose a free press, freedom of worship, and certifiably free and fair elections.\nWe must strengthen the alliance of the industrial democracies, as solid a force for peace as the world has ever known. And this is an alliance forged by the power of our ideals, not the pettiness of our differences. So, let's lift our sights to rise above fighting about beef hormones, to building a better future, to move from protectionism to progress.\nI've asked the Secretary of State to visit Europe next week and to consult with our allies on the wide range of challenges and opportunities we face together, including East-West relations. And I look forward to meeting with our NATO partners in the near future.\nAnd I, too, shall begin a trip shortly to the far reaches of the Pacific Basin, where the winds of democracy are creating new hope and the power of free markets is unleashing a new force. When I served as our representative in China 14 or 15 years ago, few would have predicted the scope of the changes we've witnessed since then. But in preparing for this trip, I was struck by something I came across from a Chinese writer. He was speaking of his country, decades ago, but his words speak to each of us in America tonight. ``Today, he said, ``we're afraid of the simple words like `goodness' and `mercy' and `kindness.' My friends, if we're to succeed as a nation, we must rediscover those words.\nIn just 3 days, we mark the birthday of Abraham Lincoln, the man who saved our Union and gave new meaning to the word ``opportunity. Lincoln once said: ``I hold that while man exists, it is his duty to improve not only his own condition but to assist in ameliorating that of mankind. It is this broader mission to which I call all Americans, because the definition of a successful life must include serving others.\nAnd to the young people of America, who sometimes feel left out, I ask you tonight to give us the benefit of your talent and energy through a new program called YES, for Youth Entering Service to America.\nTo those men and women in business, remember the ultimate end of your work: to make a better product, to create better lives. I ask you to plan for the longer term and avoid that temptation of quick and easy paper profits.\nTo the brave men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of America, thank you. Your calling is a high one: to be the defenders of freedom and the guarantors of liberty. And I want you to know that this nation is grateful for your service.\nTo the farmers of America, we appreciate the bounty you provide. We will work with you to open foreign markets to American agricultural products.\nAnd to the parents of America, I ask you to get involved in your child's schooling. Check on the homework, go to the school, meet the teachers, care about what is happening there. It's not only your child's future on the line, it's America's.\nTo kids in our cities, don't give up hope. Say no to drugs; stay in school. And, yes, ``Keep hope alive.\nTo those 37 million Americans with some form of disability, you belong in the economic mainstream. We need your talents in America's work force. Disabled Americans must become full partners in America's opportunity society.\nTo the families of America watching tonight in your living rooms, hold fast to your dreams because ultimately America's future rests in your hands.\nAnd to my friends in this Chamber, I ask your cooperation to keep America growing while cutting the deficit. That's only fair to those who now have no vote: the generations to come. Let them look back and say that we had the foresight to understand that a time of peace and prosperity is not the time to rest but a time to press forward, a time to invest in the future.\nAnd let all Americans remember that no problem of human making is too great to be overcome by human ingenuity, human energy, and the untiring hope of the human spirit. I believe this. I would not have asked to be your President if I didn't. And tomorrow the debate on the plan I've put forward begins, and I ask the Congress to come forward with your own proposals. Let's not question each other's motives. Let's debate, let's negotiate; but let us solve the problem.\nRecalling anniversaries may not be my specialty in speeches but tonight is one of some note. On February 9th, 1941, just 48 years ago tonight, Sir Winston Churchill took to the airwaves during Britain's hour of peril. He'd received from President Roosevelt a hand-carried letter quoting Longfellow's famous poem: ``Sail on, O Ship of State! Sail on, O Union, strong and great! Humanity with all its fears, With all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on thy fate! And Churchill responded on this night by radio broadcast to a nation at war, but he directed his words to Franklin Roosevelt. ``We shall not fail or falter, he said. ``We shall not weaken or tire. Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.\nTonight, almost half a century later, our peril may be less immediate, but the need for perseverance and clear-sighted fortitude is just as great. Now, as then, there are those who say it can't be done. There are voices who say that America's best days have passed, that we're bound by constraints, threatened by problems, surrounded by troubles which limit our ability to hope. Well, tonight I remain full of hope. We Americans have only begun on our mission of goodness and greatness. And to those timid souls, I repeat the plea: ``Give us the tools, and we will do the job.\nThank you. God bless you, and God bless America.\n","U shit boy","I put down more hits than mafioso made\nAnd Lucky Lucianno 'bout to sing soprano\nAnd I know, I know the way you feel\nAnd baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real\nJust to get you caught up in amazement\nWe puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous\nBut when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack\nAnd let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha\nHow you feelin'?

The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases—having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"runs\". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.\n\nThe first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely. A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called \"out\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.\n\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan and South Korea.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League. The World Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world.\n\n\n\nA baseball game is played between two teams, each composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an inning. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in college and minor leagues, and six innings at the Little League level). One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond. A player bats at home plate and must proceed counterclockwise to first base, second base, third base, and back home to score a run. The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring and record outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team's batting order comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.\n\nThe game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height. The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.\n\nThere are three basic tools of baseball: the ball, the bat, and the glove or mitt: Protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters.\n * The baseball is about the size of an adult's fist, around 9 inches (23 centimeters) in circumference. It has a rubber or cork center, wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide, with red stitching.\n * The bat is a hitting tool, traditionally made of a single, solid piece of wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around 34 inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42 inches (106 centimeters).\n * The glove or mitt is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers. As an aid in catching and holding onto the ball, it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions.\n\nAt the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the catcher, squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well.\n\nPlay starts with a batter standing at home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts to hit the ball with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out is said to be safe and is on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.\n\nAny runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before or after the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they occupied when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up (contact the base they occupied when the play began, as or after the ball is caught). Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate; a successful effort is a stolen base.\n\nA pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.\n\nWhile the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs. In addition to the strikeout, common ways a member of the batting team may be put out include the flyout, ground out, force out, and tag out. It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play. This is called a double play. Three outs in one play, a triple play, is possible, though rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty.\n\nAn individual player's turn batting or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team's third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.\n\nIf the designated hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH takes the place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of players on a baseball roster, or squad, varies by league and by the level of organized play. A Major League Baseball (MLB) team has a roster of 25 players with specific roles. A typical roster features the following players:\n * Eight position players: the catcher, four infielders, and three outfielders—all of whom play on a regular basis\n * Five starting pitchers who constitute the team's pitching rotation or starting rotation\n * Six relief pitchers, including one closer, who constitute the team's bullpen (named for the off-field area where pitchers warm up)\n * One backup, or substitute, catcher\n * Two backup infielders\n * Two backup outfielders\n * One pinch hitter, or a second backup catcher, or a seventh reliever\n\nMost baseball leagues worldwide have the DH rule, including MLB's American League, Japan's Pacific League, and Caribbean professional leagues, along with major American amateur organizations. The Central League in Japan and the National League do not have the rule, and high-level minor league clubs connected to National League teams are not required to field a DH. In leagues that apply the designated hitter rule, a typical team has nine offensive regulars (including the DH), five starting pitchers, seven or eight relievers, a backup catcher, and two or three other reserve players.\n\nThe manager, or head coach, oversees the team's major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers. Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning. At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, occupying designated coaches' boxes just outside the foul lines, assist in the direction of baserunners when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners during pauses in play. In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform to be allowed on the field to confer with players during a game.\n\nAny baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In MLB, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.\n\nMany of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder.\n\n\n\nThe tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, as well as its general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, which permits any runners on base to advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.\n\nSeveral basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even at the expense of the batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.\n\nThe evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular among children in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by American baseball historian David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and \"tut-ball\". The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. Block discovered that the first recorded game of \"Bass-Ball\" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player. This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants.\n\nBy the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America. The first officially recorded baseball game on this continent was played in Beachville, Ontario, Canada on June 4, 1838. In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of New York City's Knickerbocker Club, led the codification of the so-called Knickerbocker Rules. While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey: the \"New York Nine\" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings. With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area, and by 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the \"national pastime\" or \"national game\". A year later, the sport's first governing body, the National Association of Base Ball Players, was formed. In 1867, it barred participation by African Americans. The more formally structured National League was founded in 1876. Professional Negro leagues formed, but quickly folded. In 1887, softball, under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game. The National League's first successful counterpart, the American League, which evolved from the minor Western League, was established in 1893, and virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by then.\n\nThe National Agreement of 1903 formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall. The Black Sox Scandal of the 1919 World Series led to the formation of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together. The first major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.\n\nCompared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers were more dominant. The so-called dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict new regulations governed the ball's size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the spitball and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. The rise of the legendary player Babe Ruth, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern farm system. A new Negro National League was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the Negro American League. The first elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame took place in 1936. In 1939, Little League Baseball was founded in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nA large number of minor league teams disbanded when World War II led to a player shortage. Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley led the formation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League to help keep the game in the public eye. The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred in 1945: Jackie Robinson was signed by the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers and began playing for their minor league team in Montreal. In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers. Latin American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born Chico Carrasquel and black Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso, became the first Hispanic All-Stars. Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster.\n\nIn 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system. Significant work stoppages occurred in 1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years. Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance. After play resumed in 1995, non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of MLB.\n\nIn 2001, Barry Bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004. In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing Hank Aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs.\n\nWidely known as America's pastime, baseball is well established in several other countries as well. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both Canada and the US. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League.\n\nIn 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at Parque Los Berros in Xalapa, Veracruz. The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada was founded in 1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition. The Dominican Republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912. Professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars, including the Netherlands (formed in 1922), Australia (1934), Japan (1936), Mexico (1937), and Puerto Rico (1938). The Japanese major leagues have long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the United States.\n\nAfter World War II, professional leagues were founded in many Latin American countries, most prominently Venezuela (1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955). Since the early 1970s, the annual Caribbean Series has matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues: the Dominican Professional Baseball League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. In Asia, South Korea (1982), Taiwan (1990) and China (2003) all have professional leagues.\n\nMany European countries have professional leagues as well; the most successful, other than the Dutch league, is the Italian league, founded in 1948. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the Olympic Games. The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries. Other competitions between national teams, such as the Baseball World Cup and the Olympic baseball tournament, were administered by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). Women's baseball is played on an organized amateur basis in numerous countries.\n\nAfter being admitted to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Games. While the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was MLB's reluctance to allow its players to participate during the major league season. MLB initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede its season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.\n\nBaseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none of them is the variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.\n\nIn clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even in the case of multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss.\n\nWhile nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters). In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete. The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently. Other leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.\n\nIn 2016, the average nine-inning playoff game in Major League baseball was 3 hours and 35 minutes. This was up 10 minutes from 2015 and 21 minutes from 2014.\n\nAlthough baseball is a team sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure. In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: \"the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits\". Contrasting the game with both football and basketball, scholar Michael Mandelbaum argues that \"baseball is the one closest in evolutionary descent to the older individual sports\". Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it. As described by Mandelbaum,\n\n\"It is impossible to isolate and objectively assess the contribution each [football] team member makes to the outcome of the play... [E]very basketball player is interacting with all of his teammates all the time. In baseball, by contrast, every player is more or less on his own... Baseball is therefore a realm of complete transparency and total responsibility. A baseball player lives in a glass house, and in a stark moral universe... Everything that every player does is accounted for and everything accounted for is either good or bad, right or wrong.\"\n\nCricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.\n\n\n\nUnlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams following the rules of MLB and Minor League Baseball is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of 325 ft from home plate to the fences in left and right field and 400 ft to center. Major league teams often skirt even this rule. For example, at Minute Maid Park, which became the home of the Houston Astros in 2000, the Crawford Boxes in left field are only 315 ft from home plate. There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's Fenway Park, in use since 1912: the Green Monster is 310 ft from home plate down the line and 37 ft tall.\n\nSimilarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.\n\n\n\nThese physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies. Its high altitude—5282 ft above sea level—is partly responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure. Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in. The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball 330 ft into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.\n\nOrganized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, was responsible for the \"development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball.\" The statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball. In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian Alan Schwarz describes as a \"tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.\"\n\nThe Official Baseball Rules administered by MLB require the official scorer to categorize each baseball play unambiguously. The rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency. The score report is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records. General managers, managers, and baseball scouts use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions.\n\nCertain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans. The basic batting statistics include: The basic baserunning statistics include: The basic pitching statistics include: The basic fielding statistics include:\n * At bats: plate appearances, excluding walks and hit by pitches—where the batter's ability is not fully tested—and sacrifices and sacrifice flies—where the batter intentionally makes an out in order to advance one or more baserunners\n * Hits: times reached base because of a batted, fair ball without fielding error or fielder's choice\n * Runs: times circling the bases and reaching home safely\n * Runs batted in (RBIs): number of runners who scored due to a batter's action (including the batter, in the case of a home run), except when batter grounded into double play or reached on an error\n * Home runs: hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases, without the contribution of a fielding error\n * Batting average: hits divided by at bats—the traditional measure of batting ability\n * Stolen bases: times advancing to the next base entirely due to the runner's own efforts, generally while the pitcher is preparing to deliver or delivering the ball\n * Caught stealing: times tagged out while attempting to steal a base\n * Wins: credited to pitcher on winning team who last pitched before the team took a lead that it never relinquished (a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win)\n * Losses: charged to pitcher on losing team who was pitching when the opposing team took a lead that it never relinquished\n * Saves: games where the pitcher enters a game led by the pitcher's team, finishes the game without surrendering the lead, is not the winning pitcher, and either (a) the lead was three runs or less when the pitcher entered the game; (b) the potential tying run was on base, at bat, or on deck; or (c) the pitcher pitched three or more innings\n * Innings pitched: outs recorded while pitching divided by three (partial innings are conventionally recorded as, e.g., \"5.2\" or \"7.1\", the last digit actually representing thirds, not tenths, of an inning)\n * Strikeouts: times pitching three strikes to a batter\n * Winning percentage: wins divided by decisions (wins plus losses)\n * Earned run average (ERA): runs allowed, excluding those resulting from fielding errors, per nine innings pitched\n * Putouts: times the fielder catches a fly ball, tags or forces out a runner, or otherwise directly effects an out\n * Assists: times a putout by another fielder was recorded following the fielder touching the ball\n * Errors: times the fielder fails to make a play that should have been made with common effort, and the batting team benefits as a result\n * Total chances: putouts plus assists plus errors\n * Fielding average: successful chances (putouts plus assists) divided by total chances\n\nAmong the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics. For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.\n\nSabermetrics refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools. The term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves. The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, Bill James, and derives from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).\n\nThe growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average:\n * On-base percentage measures a batter's ability to get on base. It is calculated by taking the sum of the batter's successes in getting on base (hits plus walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter's total plate appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies), except for sacrifice bunts.\n * Slugging percentage measures a batter's ability to hit for power. It is calculated by taking the batter's total bases (one per each single, two per double, three per triple, and four per home run) and dividing that by the batter's at bats.\n\nSome of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use:\n * On-base plus slugging (OPS) measures a batter's overall ability. It is calculated by adding the batter's on-base percentage and slugging percentage.\n * Walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) measures a pitcher's ability at preventing hitters from reaching base. It is calculated exactly as its name suggests.\n\nWriting in 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball as America's national religion. In the words of sports columnist Jayson Stark, baseball has long been \"a unique paragon of American culture\"—a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal. Baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes \"how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba, [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in Japan.\" Since the early 1980s, the Dominican Republic, in particular the city of San Pedro de Macorís, has been the major leagues' primary source of foreign talent. In 2017, 83 of the 868 players on MLB Opening Day rosters (and disabled lists) were from the country. Among other Caribbean countries and territories, a combined 97 MLB players were born in Venezuela, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. Hall-of-Famer Roberto Clemente remains one of the greatest national heroes in Puerto Rico's history. While baseball has long been the island's primary athletic pastime, its once well-attended professional winter league has declined in popularity since 1990, when young Puerto Rican players began to be included in the major leagues' annual first-year player draft. In Asia, baseball is among the most popular sports in Japan and South Korea.\n\nThe major league game in the United States was originally targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience. A century later, the situation was very different. With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports.\n\nOverall, baseball has a large following in the United States; a 2006 poll found that nearly half of Americans are fans. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, baseball's position compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions. In 2008, MLB set a revenue record of $6.5 billion, matching the NFL's revenue for the first time in decades. A new MLB revenue record of more than $10 billion was set in 2017. On the other hand, the percentage of American sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 9%, compared to pro football at 37%. In 1985, the respective figures were pro football 24%, baseball 23%. Because there are so many more major league games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance. In 2008, total attendance at major league games was the second-highest in history: 78.6 million, 0.7% off the record set the previous year. The following year, amid the U.S. recession, attendance fell by 6.6% to 73.4 million. Eight years later, it dropped under 73 million. Attendance at games held under the Minor League Baseball umbrella set a record in 2008, with 43.3 million.\n\nIn Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues, was estimated at $1 billion in 2007. Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million. While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures were stagnant. There are concerns that MLB's growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country. In Cuba, where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport, the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top-level domestic leagues. Revenue figures are not released for the country's amateur system. Similarly, according to one official pronouncement, the sport's governing authority \"has never taken into account attendance ... because its greatest interest has always been the development of athletes\".\n\n, Little League Baseball oversees leagues with close to 2.4 million participants in over 80 countries. The number of players has fallen since the 1990s, when 3 million children took part in Little League Baseball annually. Babe Ruth League teams have over 1 million participants. According to the president of the International Baseball Federation, between 300,000 and 500,000 women and girls play baseball around the world, including Little League and the introductory game of Tee Ball.\n\nA varsity baseball team is an established part of physical education departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2015, nearly half a million high schoolers and over 34,000 collegians played on their schools' baseball teams. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.\n\n\n\nBaseball has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the United States and elsewhere. Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game is the source of a number of widely used sexual euphemisms. The first networked radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City's Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by wire to WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts. The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.\n\nBaseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment. One of the first major examples, Ernest Thayer's poem \"Casey at the Bat\", appeared in 1888. A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a \"clutch situation\", the poem became the source of vaudeville and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. There have been many baseball movies, including the Academy Award–winning The Pride of the Yankees (1942) and the Oscar nominees The Natural (1984) and Field of Dreams (1989). The American Film Institute's selection of the ten best sports movies includes The Pride of the Yankees at number 3 and Bull Durham (1988) at number 5. Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage—the Adler–Ross musical Damn Yankees—and record—George J. Gaskin's \"Slide, Kelly, Slide\", Simon and Garfunkel's \"Mrs. Robinson\", and John Fogerty's \"Centerfield\". The baseball-inspired comedic sketch \"Who's on First\", popularized by Abbott and Costello in 1938, quickly became famous. Six decades later, Time named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century.\n\nLiterary works connected to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (the source for the movie), Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop., and W. P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe (the source for Field of Dreams). Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of Damon Runyon; the columns of Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, and Peter Gammons; and the essays of Roger Angell. Among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are Lawrence S. Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, and Michael Lewis's Moneyball. The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton's tell-all chronicle Ball Four is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports.\n\nBaseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example featured an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.\n\nModern fantasy sports began in 1980 with the invention of Rotisserie League Baseball by New York writer Daniel Okrent and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active MLB players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as fantasy baseball, it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports. The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports-related websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800 million on the hobby. The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.\n\n","Hi, I will wait for u near the DBS bank at b1.","The world has turned and left me here.\nJust where I was before you appeared, and in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face.\n\nI just made love with your sweet memory one thousand times in my head.\nYou said you loved it more than ever.\n\nYou remain turned away, turning further every day.\n\nI talked for hours to your wallet photograph and you just listened.\nYou laughed enchanted by intellect, or maybe you didn't.\n\nYou remain turned away, turning further every day.\n\n","\nTHE _symposium_ of the preceding evening had been a little too much\nfor my nerves. I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.\nInstead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed,\nit occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a\nmouthful of supper and go immediately to bed.\n\nA light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More\nthan a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still,\nthere can be no material objection to two. And really between two and\nthree, there is merely a single unit of difference. I ventured, perhaps,\nupon four. My wife will have it five;--but, clearly, she has confounded\ntwo very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to\nadmit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout,\nwithout which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.\n\nHaving thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the\nserene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon\nthe pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a\nprofound slumber forthwith.\n\nBut when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I could not have\ncompleted my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the\nstreet-door bell, and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which\nawakened me at once. In a minute afterward, and while I was still\nrubbing my eyes, my wife thrust in my face a note, from my old friend,\nDoctor Ponnonner. It ran thus:\n\n      “Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you\n receive this. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering\n diplomacy, I have gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum,\n to my examination of the Mummy--you know the one I mean. I have\n permission to unswathe it and open it, if desirable. A few friends only\n will be present--you, of course. The Mummy is now at my house, and we\n shall begin to unroll it at eleven to-night.\n\n           “Yours, ever,\n\n                   PONNONNER.\n\nBy the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was\nas wide awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy,\noverthrowing all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly\nmarvellous; and set off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s.\n\nThere I found a very eager company assembled. They had been awaiting me\nwith much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and\nthe moment I entered its examination was commenced.\n\nIt was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain\nArthur Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in\nthe Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.\nThe grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban\nsepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more\nnumerous illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber\nfrom which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such\nillustrations; the walls being completely covered with fresco paintings\nand bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich patterns,\nindicated the vast wealth of the deceased.\n\nThe treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same\ncondition in which Captain Sabretash had found it;--that is to say,\nthe coffin had not been disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood,\nsubject only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore,\nthe complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very\nrarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident,\nat once that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good\nfortune.\n\nApproaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven\nfeet long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It\nwas oblong--not coffin-shaped. The material was at first supposed to\nbe the wood of the sycamore (_platanus_), but, upon cutting into it, we\nfound it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, _papier mache_, composed\nof papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing\nfuneral scenes, and other mournful subjects--interspersed among which,\nin every variety of position, were certain series of hieroglyphical\ncharacters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the departed. By good\nluck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no difficulty in\ntranslating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the\nword _Allamistakeo_.\n\nWe had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury;\nbut having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second,\ncoffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one,\nbut resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval between\nthe two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the\ncolors of the interior box.\n\nUpon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a\nthird case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no\nparticular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still\nemitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. Between\nthe second and the third case there was no interval--the one fitting\naccurately within the other.\n\nRemoving the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself.\nWe had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or\nbandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath,\nmade of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and\npainted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the\nvarious supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different\ndivinities, with numerous identical human figures, intended, very\nprobably, as portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from head\nto foot was a columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic\nhieroglyphics, giving again his name and titles, and the names and\ntitles of his relations.\n\nAround the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass\nbeads, diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities,\nof the scarabaeus, etc, with the winged globe. Around the small of the\nwaist was a similar collar or belt.\n\nStripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation,\nwith no perceptible odor. The color was reddish. The skin was hard,\nsmooth, and glossy. The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes\n(it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were\nvery beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat\ntoo determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly\ngilded.\n\nMr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the\nembalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping\nthe surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of\nthe powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented\ngums became apparent.\n\nWe searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through\nwhich the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could\ndiscover none. No member of the party was at that period aware that\nentire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met. The brain it\nwas customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an\nincision in the side; the body was then shaved, washed, and salted; then\nlaid aside for several weeks, when the operation of embalming, properly\nso called, began.\n\nAs no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing\nhis instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past\ntwo o’clock. Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination\nuntil the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present,\nwhen some one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.\n\nThe application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years\nold at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently\noriginal, and we all caught it at once. About one-tenth in earnest and\nnine-tenths in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and\nconveyed thither the Egyptian.\n\nIt was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some\nportions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity\nthan other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of\ncourse, gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in\ncontact with the wire. This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive,\nand, with a hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each\nother good night, when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the\nMummy, were there immediately riveted in amazement. My brief glance, in\nfact, had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed\nto be glass, and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild\nstare, were now so far covered by the lids, that only a small portion of\nthe _tunica albuginea_ remained visible.\n\nWith a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately\nobvious to all.\n\nI cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is,\nin my case, not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for\nthe Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous. As for the rest\nof the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright\nfright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied.\nMr. Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr.\nSilk Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he\nmade his way, upon all fours, under the table.\n\nAfter the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter\nof course, upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now\ndirected against the great toe of the right foot. We made an incision\nover the outside of the exterior _os sesamoideum pollicis pedis,_ and\nthus got at the root of the abductor muscle. Readjusting the battery, we\nnow applied the fluid to the bisected nerves--when, with a movement of\nexceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to\nbring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the\nlimb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner,\nwhich had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a\ncatapult, through a window into the street below.\n\nWe rushed out _en masse_ to bring in the mangled remains of the victim,\nbut had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an\nunaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more\nthan ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment\nwith vigor and with zeal.\n\nIt was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a\nprofound incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor\nhimself, laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact\nwith the wire.\n\nMorally and physically--figuratively and literally--was the effect\nelectric. In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked very\nrapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime, in the\nsecond place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the fourth,\nit shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth, turning to\nMessieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very capital\nEgyptian, thus:\n\n“I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at\nyour behavior. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He\nis a poor little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him.\nBut you, Mr. Gliddon--and you, Silk--who have travelled and resided in\nEgypt until one might imagine you to the manner born--you, I say who\nhave been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I\nthink, as you write your mother tongue--you, whom I have always been\nled to regard as the firm friend of the mummies--I really did anticipate\nmore gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think of your standing\nquietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to suppose by\nyour permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins, and my\nclothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to the\npoint) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little\nvillain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”\n\nIt will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech\nunder the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into\nviolent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. One of these three\nthings was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines of\nconduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I am\nat a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor\nthe other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit\nof the age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and\nis now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of\nparadox and impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the\nMummy’s exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his\nwords of the terrible. However this may be, the facts are clear, and no\nmember of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed\nto consider that any thing had gone very especially wrong.\n\nFor my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside,\nout of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his\nhands into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew\nexcessively red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew\nup the collar of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put\nhis right thumb into the left corner of his mouth.\n\nThe Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and\nat length, with a sneer, said:\n\n“Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you hear what I asked you, or\nnot? Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”\n\nMr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out\nof the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted\nhis left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.\n\nNot being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly\nto Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms\nwhat we all meant.\n\nMr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the\ndeficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would\nafford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of\nhis very excellent speech.\n\nI may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent\nconversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive\nEgyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other\nuntravelled members of the company)--through the medium, I say, of\nMessieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke\nthe mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I\ncould not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of\nimages entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger)\nthe two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of\nsensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning.\nMr. Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian\ncomprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with\na bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows,\nstanding upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown\nforward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and\nthe mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. Just in the same way Mr.\nBuckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until\n(at Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and\nconsented to take off his own.\n\nIt will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned\nchiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling\nand disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any\ndisturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the\nindividual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint\n(for it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little\nmatters were now explained, it might be as well to proceed with\nthe investigation intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his\ninstruments.\n\nIn regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that\nAllamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I\ndid not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the\napologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with\nthe company all round.\n\nWhen this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in\nrepairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel.\nWe sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a\nsquare inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.\n\nIt was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of\nAllamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering--no doubt from the cold. The\nDoctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with\na black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue\nplaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of\nbrocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with\nno brim, patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a\npair of whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size\nbetween the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one),\nthere was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the\nperson of the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been\nsaid to be dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led\nhim to a comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell\nupon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.\n\nThe conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course,\nexpressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s\nstill remaining alive.\n\n“I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham, “that it is high time\nyou were dead.”\n\n“Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I am little more than\nseven hundred years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means\nin his dotage when he died.”\n\nHere ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of\nwhich it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly\nmisjudged. It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months\nsince he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.\n\n“But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had no reference to your age\nat the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are\nstill a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during\nwhich, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.”\n\n“In what?” said the Count.\n\n“In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B.\n\n“Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made\nto answer, no doubt--but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else\nthan the Bichloride of Mercury.”\n\n“But what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said Doctor\nPonnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt\nfive thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so\ndelightfully well.”\n\n“Had I been, as you say, dead,” replied the Count, “it is more than\nprobable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the\ninfancy of Calvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common\nthing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy,\nand it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or\nshould be; they accordingly embalmed me at once--I presume you are aware\nof the chief principle of the embalming process?”\n\n“Why not altogether.”\n\n“Why, I perceive--a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot\nenter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to\nembalm (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the\nanimal functions subjected to the process. I use the word ‘animal’ in\nits widest sense, as including the physical not more than the moral\nand vital being. I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment\nconsisted, with us, in the immediately arresting, and holding in\nperpetual abeyance, all the animal functions subjected to the process.\nTo be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at the period of\nembalmment, in that condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune\nto be of the blood of the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see\nme at present.”\n\n“The blood of the Scarabaeus!” exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.\n\n“Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very\ndistinguished and very rare patrician family. To be ‘of the blood of the\nScarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus\nis the insignium. I speak figuratively.”\n\n“But what has this to do with you being alive?”\n\n“Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before\nembalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone\ndid not coincide with the custom. Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore,\nI should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is\ninconvenient to live.”\n\n“I perceive that,” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the\nentire mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.”\n\n“Beyond doubt.”\n\n“I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, “that the Scarabaeus was one\nof the Egyptian gods.”\n\n“One of the Egyptian _what?”_ exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its feet.\n\n“Gods!” repeated the traveller.\n\n“Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,”\n said the Count, resuming his chair. “No nation upon the face of the\nearth has ever acknowledged more than one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis,\netc., were with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the\nsymbols, or media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too\naugust to be more directly approached.”\n\nThere was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor\nPonnonner.\n\n“It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he,\n“that among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of\nthe Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?”\n\n“There can be no question of it,” replied the Count; “all the Scarabaei\nembalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those\npurposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and\nstill remain in the tomb.”\n\n“Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what you mean by\n‘purposely so embalmed’?”\n\n“With great pleasure!” answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely\nthrough his eye-glass--for it was the first time I had ventured to\naddress him a direct question.\n\n“With great pleasure,” he said. “The usual duration of man’s life, in\nmy time, was about eight hundred years. Few men died, unless by most\nextraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer\nthan a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural\nterm. After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already\ndescribed it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable\ncuriosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of\nscience much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. In\nthe case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of\nthis kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained\nthe age of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then\nget himself carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors\npro tem., that they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of\na certain period--say five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at\nthe expiration of this time, he would invariably find his great work\nconverted into a species of hap-hazard note-book--that is to say, into\na kind of literary arena for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and\npersonal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated commentators.\nThese guesses, etc., which passed under the name of annotations, or\nemendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and\noverwhelmed the text, that the author had to go about with a lantern to\ndiscover his own book. When discovered, it was never worth the trouble\nof the search. After re-writing it throughout, it was regarded as the\nbounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately\nin correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience, the\ntraditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally\nlived. Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification,\npursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of\npreventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his\nhand gently upon the arm of the Egyptian--“I beg your pardon, sir, but\nmay I presume to interrupt you for one moment?”\n\n“By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up.\n\n“I merely wished to ask you a question,” said the Doctor. “You mentioned\nthe historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own\nepoch. Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were\nusually found to be right?”\n\n“The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered\nto be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written\nhistories themselves;--that is to say, not one individual iota of either\nwas ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and radically\nwrong.”\n\n“But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor, “that at least five\nthousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for\ngranted that your histories at that period, if not your traditions\nwere sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the\nCreation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten\ncenturies before.”\n\n“Sir!” said the Count Allamistakeo.\n\nThe Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional\nexplanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The\nlatter at length said, hesitatingly:\n\n“The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel.\nDuring my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy\nas that the universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had\na beginning at all. I remember once, and once only, hearing something\nremotely hinted, by a man of many speculations, concerning the origin\n_of the human race;_ and by this individual, the very word _Adam_\n(or Red Earth), which you make use of, was employed. He employed\nit, however, in a generical sense, with reference to the spontaneous\ngermination from rank soil (just as a thousand of the lower genera of\ncreatures are germinated)--the spontaneous germination, I say, of five\nvast hordes of men, simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and\nnearly equal divisions of the globe.”\n\nHere, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or\ntwo of us touched our foreheads with a very significant air. Mr. Silk\nBuckingham, first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the\nsinciput of Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:\n\n“The long duration of human life in your time, together with\nthe occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in\ninstallments, must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general\ndevelopment and conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that\nwe are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in\nall particulars of science, when compared with the moderns, and more\nespecially with the Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the\nEgyptian skull.”\n\n“I confess again,” replied the Count, with much suavity, “that I am\nsomewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of\nscience do you allude?”\n\nHere our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the\nassumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.\n\nHaving heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few\nanecdotes, which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and\nSpurzheim had flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been\nnearly forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very\ncontemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles\nof the Theban savans, who created lice and a great many other similar\nthings.\n\nI here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He\nsmiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.\n\nThis put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard\nto his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had\nnever as yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information\non this head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well\nas one Plutarch de facie lunae.\n\nI then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in\ngeneral, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my\nqueries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,\nand begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus. As\nfor the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns\npossessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the\nstyle of the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer\nthis question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very\nextraordinary way.\n\n“Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of\nboth the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.\n\n“Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New\nYork! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the\nCapitol at Washington, D. C.!”--and the good little medical man went\non to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he\nreferred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less\nthan four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.\n\nThe Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just\nat that moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal\nbuildings of the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night\nof Time, but the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of\nhis entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He\nrecollected, however, (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to\nan inferior palace in a kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a\nhundred and forty-four columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and\ntwenty-five feet apart. The approach to this portico, from the Nile,\nwas through an avenue two miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and\nobelisks, twenty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself\n(as well as he could remember) was, in one direction, two miles long,\nand might have been altogether about seven in circuit. Its walls were\nrichly painted all over, within and without, with hieroglyphics. He\nwould not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s\nCapitols might have been built within these walls, but he was by\nno means sure that two or three hundred of them might not have\nbeen squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at Carnac was an\ninsignificant little building after all. He (the Count), however, could\nnot conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and\nsuperiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as described by the\nDoctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever been seen in\nEgypt or elsewhere.\n\nI here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.\n\n“Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were rather slight, rather\nill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of\ncourse, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which\nthe Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred\nand fifty feet in altitude.\n\nI spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.\n\nHe agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should\nhave gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the\nlittle palace at Carnac.\n\nThis question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea\nof Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon\nwinked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been\nrecently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the\nGreat Oasis.\n\nI then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and\nasked me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on\nthe obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.\n\nThis disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the\nattack to Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,”\n and read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very\nclear, but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.\n\nThe Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in\nhis day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but\nit never progressed.\n\nWe then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and\nwere at much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the\nadvantages we enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and\nno king.\n\nHe listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little\namused. When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had\noccurred something of a very similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces\ndetermined all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to\nthe rest of mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the\nmost ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they\nmanaged remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious.\nThe thing ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states,\nwith some fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable\ndespotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.\n\nI asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.\n\nAs well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.\n\nNot knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the\nEgyptian ignorance of steam.\n\nThe Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. The\nsilent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his\nelbows--told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once--and demanded\nif I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern steam-engine\nis derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de Caus.\n\nWe were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck\nwould have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue,\nand inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the\nmoderns in the all--important particular of dress.\n\nThe Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons,\nand then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up\nclose to his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth\nextended itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember\nthat he said any thing in the way of reply.\n\nHereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy\nwith great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as\na gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the\nmanufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.\n\nWe looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer--but in vain. It was\nnot forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was\ntriumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a\ngrace. Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s\nmortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.\n\nUpon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately\nto bed. It is now ten A.M. I have been up since seven, penning these\nmemoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind. The former I\nshall behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is, I am heartily\nsick of this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am\nconvinced that every thing is going wrong. Besides, I am anxious to\nknow who will be President in 2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and\nswallow a cup of coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner’s and get\nembalmed for a couple of hundred years.\n\n"]
